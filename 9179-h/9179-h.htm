      regarder beaucoup et songer à ce qu&rsquo;on a vu. Voir: tout est là, et voir
      juste. J&rsquo;entends, par voir juste, voir avec ses propres yeux et non avec
      ceux des maîtres. L&rsquo;originalité d&rsquo;un artiste s&rsquo;indique d&rsquo;abord dans les

    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Any one about to read this work of fiction might properly be apprised
      beforehand that it is not a novel: it has neither the structure nor the
      purpose of The Novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a story. There are two characters&mdash;a middle-aged married couple
      living in a plain farmhouse; one point on the field of human nature is
      located; at that point one subject is treated; in the treatment one
      movement is directed toward one climax; no external event whatsoever is
      introduced; and the time is about forty hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second story of equal length, laid in the same house, is expected to
      appear within a twelvemonth. The same father and mother are characters,
      and the family friend the country doctor; but subordinately all. The main
      story concerns itself with the four children of the two households.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an American children&rsquo;s story:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Brood of The Eagle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the year a third work, not fiction, will be published, entitled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Christmas Tree: An Interpretation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three works will serve to complete each other, and they complete a
      cycle of the theme.

    <h2>
      EARTH SHIELD AND EARTH FESTIVAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      A mighty table-land lies southward in a hardy region of our country. It
      has the form of a colossal Shield, lacking and broken in some of its
      outlines and rough and rude of make. Nature forged it for some crisis in
      her long warfare of time and change, made use of it, and so left it lying
      as one of her ancient battle-pieces&mdash;Kentucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Shield is raised high out of the earth at one end and sunk deep
      into it at the other. It is tilted away from the dawn toward the sunset.
      Where the western dip of it reposes on the planet, Nature, cunning
      artificer, set the stream of ocean flowing past with restless foam&mdash;the
      Father of Waters. Along the edge for a space she bound a bright river to
      the rim of silver. And where the eastern part rises loftiest on the
      horizon, turned away from the reddening daybreak, she piled shaggy
      mountains wooded with trees that loose their leaves ere snowflakes fly and
      with steadfast evergreens which hold to theirs through the gladdening and
      the saddening year. Then crosswise over the middle of the Shield,
      northward and southward upon the breadth of it, covering the life-born
      rock of many thicknesses, she drew a tough skin of verdure&mdash;a broad
      strip of hide of the ever growing grass. She embossed noble forests on
      this greensward and under the forests drew clear waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      This she did in a time of which we know nothing&mdash;uncharted ages
      before man had emerged from the deeps of ocean with eyes to wonder,
      thoughts to wander, heart to love, and spirit to pray. Many a scene the
      same power has wrought out upon the surface of the Shield since she
      brought him forth and set him there: many an old one, many a new. She has
      made it sometimes a Shield of war, sometimes a Shield of peace. Nor has
      she yet finished with its destinies as she has not yet finished with
      anything in the universe. While therefore she continues her will and
      pleasure elsewhere throughout creation, she does not forget the Shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      She likes sometimes to set upon it scenes which admonish man how little
      his lot has changed since Hephaistos wrought like scenes upon the shield
      of Achilles, and Thetis of the silver feet sprang like a falcon from snowy
      Olympus bearing the glittering piece of armor to her angered son.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are some of the scenes that were wrought on the shield of Achilles
      and that to-day are spread over the Earth Shield Kentucky:
    </p>
    <p>
      Espousals and marriage feasts and the blaze of lights as they lead the
      bride from her chamber, flutes and violins sounding merrily. An
      assembly-place where the people are gathered, a strife having arisen about
      the blood-price of a man slain; the old lawyers stand up one after another
      and make their tangled arguments in turn. Soft, freshly ploughed fields
      where ploughmen drive their teams to and fro, the earth growing dark
      behind the share. The estate of a landowner where laborers are reaping;
      some armfuls the binders are binding with twisted bands of straw: among
      them the farmer is standing in silence, leaning on his staff, rejoicing in
      his heart. Vineyards with purpling clusters and happy folk gathering these
      in plaited baskets on sunny afternoons. A herd of cattle with incurved
      horns hurrying from the stable to the woods where there is running water
      and where purple-topped weeds bend above the sleek grass. A fair glen with
      white sheep. A dancing-place under the trees; girls and young men dancing,
      their fingers on one another&rsquo;s wrists: a great company stands watching the
      lovely dance of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such pageants appeared on the shield of Achilles as art; as pageants of
      life they appear on the Earth Shield Kentucky. The metal-worker of old
      wrought them upon the armor of the Greek warrior in tin and silver, bronze
      and gold. The world-designer sets them to-day on the throbbing land in
      nerve and blood, toil and delight and passion. But there with the old
      things she mingles new things, with the never changing the ever changing;
      for the old that remains always the new and the new that perpetually
      becomes old&mdash;these Nature allots to man as his two portions wherewith
      he must abide steadfast in what he is and go upward or go downward through
      all that he is to become.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of the many scenes which she in our time sets forth upon the stately
      grassy Shield there is a single spectacle that she spreads over the length
      and breadth of it once every year now as best liked by the entire people;
      and this is both old and new.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is old because it contains man&rsquo;s faith in his immortality, which was
      venerable with age before the shield of Achilles ever grew effulgent
      before the sightless orbs of Homer. It is new because it contains those
      latest hopes and reasons for this faith, which briefly blossom out upon
      the primitive stock with the altering years and soon are blown away upon
      the winds of change. Since this spectacle, this festival, is thus old and
      is thus new and thus enwraps the deepest thing in the human spirit, it is
      never forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      When in vernal days any one turns a furrow or sows in the teeth of the
      wind and glances at the fickle sky; when under the summer shade of a
      flowering tree any one looks out upon his fatted herds and fattening
      grain; whether there is autumnal plenty in his barn or autumnal emptiness,
      autumnal peace in his breast or autumnal strife,&mdash;all days of the
      year, in the assembly-place, in the dancing-place, whatsoever of good or
      ill befall in mind or hand, never does one forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      When nights are darkest and days most dark; when the sun seems farthest
      from the planet and cheers it with lowest heat; when the fields lie shorn
      between harvest-time and seed-time and man turns wistful eyes back and
      forth between the mystery of his origin and the mystery of his end,&mdash;then
      comes the great pageant of the winter solstice, then comes Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what is Christmas? And what for centuries has it been to differing but
      always identical mortals?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was once the old pagan festival of dead Nature. It was once the old
      pagan festival of the reappearing sun. It was the pagan festival when the
      hands of labor took their rest and hunger took its fill. It was the pagan
      festival to honor the descent of the fabled inhabitants of an upper world
      upon the earth, their commerce with common flesh, and the production of a
      race of divine-and-human half-breeds. It is now the festival of the
      Immortal Child appearing in the midst of mortal children. It is now the
      new festival of man&rsquo;s remembrance of his errors and his charity toward
      erring neighbors. It has latterly become the widening festival of
      universal brotherhood with succor for all need and nighness to all
      suffering; of good will warring against ill will and of peace warring upon
      war.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus for all who have anywhere come to know it, Christmas is the
      festival of the better worldly self. But better than worldliness, it is on
      the Shield to-day what it essentially has been through many an age to many
      people&mdash;the symbolic Earth Festival of the Evergreen; setting forth
      man&rsquo;s pathetic love of youth&mdash;of his own youth that will not stay
      with him; and renewing his faith in a destiny that winds its ancient way
      upward out of dark and damp toward Eternal Light.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a story of the Earth Festival on the Earth Shield.

    <h2>
      I. THE MAN AND THE SECRET
    </h2>
    <p>
      A man sat writing near a window of an old house out in the country a few
      years ago; it was afternoon of the twenty-third of December.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the volumes of a work on American Forestry lay open on the desk
      near his right hand; and as he sometimes stopped in his writing and turned
      the leaves, the illustrations showed that the long road of his mental
      travels&mdash;for such he followed&mdash;was now passing through the
      evergreens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many notes were printed at the bottoms of the pages. They burned there
      like short tapers in dim places, often lighting up obscure faiths and
      customs of our puzzled human race. His eyes roved from taper to taper, as
      gathering knowledge ray by ray. A small book lay near the large one. It
      dealt with primitive nature-worship; and it belonged in the class of those
      that are kept under lock and key by the libraries which possess them as
      unsafe reading for unsafe minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheets of paper covered with the man&rsquo;s clear, deliberate handwriting lay
      thickly on the desk. A table in the centre of the room was strewn with
      volumes, some of a secret character, opened for reference. On the tops of
      two bookcases and on the mantelpiece were prints representing scenes from
      the oldest known art of the East. These and other prints hanging about the
      walls, however remote from each other in the times and places where they
      had been gathered, brought together in this room of a quiet Kentucky
      farmhouse evidence bearing upon the same object: the subject related in
      general to trees and in especial evergreens.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the man was immersed in his work, he appeared not to be submerged.
      His left hand was always going out to one or the other of three
      picture-frames on the desk and his fingers bent caressingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of these frames held photographs of four young children&mdash;a boy
      and a girl comprising each group. The children had the air of being well
      enough bred to be well behaved before the camera, but of being unruly and
      disorderly out of sheer health and a wild naturalness. All of them looked
      straight at you; all had eyes wide open with American frankness and good
      humor; all had mouths shut tight with American energy and determination.
      Apparently they already believed that the New World was behind them, that
      the nation backed them up. In a way you believed it. You accepted them on
      the spot as embodying that marvellous precocity in American children,
      through which they early in life become conscious of the country and claim
      it their country and believe that it claims them. Thus they took on the
      distinction of being a squad detached only photographically from the rank
      and file of the white armies of the young in the New World, millions and
      millions strong, as they march, clear-eyed, clear-headed, joyous,
      magnificent, toward new times and new destinies for the nation and for
      humanity&mdash;a kinder knowledge of man and a kinder ignorance of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third frame held the picture of a woman probably thirty years of age.
      Her features were without noticeable American characteristics. What human
      traits you saw depended upon what human traits you saw with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hair was dark and abundant, the brows dark and strong. And the lashes
      were dark and strong; and the eyes themselves, so thornily hedged about,
      somehow brought up before you a picture of autumn thistles&mdash;thistles
      that look out from the shadow of a rock. They had a veritable thistle
      quality and suggestiveness: gray and of the fields, sure of their
      experience in nature, freighted with silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite grayness and thorniness, however, you saw that they were in the
      summer of their life-bloom; and singularly above even their beauty of
      blooming they held what is rare in the eyes of either men or women&mdash;they
      held a look of being just.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole face was an oval, long, regular, high-bred. If the lower part
      had been hidden behind a white veil of the Orient (by that little bank of
      snow which is guardedly built in front of the overflowing desires of the
      mouth), the upper part would have given the impression of reserve,
      coldness, possibly of severity; yet ruled by that one look&mdash;the
      garnered wisdom, the tempering justice, of the eyes. The whole face being
      seen, the lower features altered the impression made by the upper ones;
      reserve became bettered into strength, coldness bettered into dignity,
      severity of intellect transfused into glowing nobleness of character. The
      look of virgin justice in her was perhaps what had survived from that
      white light of life which falls upon young children as from a receding sun
      and touches lingeringly their smiles and glances; but her mouth had
      gathered its shadowy tenderness as she walked the furrows of the years,
      watching their changeful harvests, eating their passing bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      A handful of some of the green things of winter lay before her picture:
      holly boughs with their bold, upright red berries; a spray of the cedar of
      the Kentucky yards with its rosary of piteous blue. When he had come in
      from out of doors to go on with his work, he had put them there&mdash;perhaps
      as some tribute. After all his years with her, many and strong, he must
      have acquired various tributes and interpretations; but to-day, during his
      walk in the woods, it had befallen him to think of her as holly which
      ripens amid snows and retains its brave freshness on a landscape of
      departed things. As cedar also which everywhere on the Shield is the best
      loved of forest-growths to be the companion of household walls; so that
      even the poorest of the people, if it does not grow near the spot they
      build in, hunt for it and bring it home: everywhere wife and cedar, wife
      and cedar, wife and cedar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The photographs of the children grouped on each side of hers with heads a
      little lower down called up memories of Old World pictures in which
      cherubs smile about the cloud-borne feet of the heavenly Hebrew maid.
      Glowing young American mother with four healthy children as her gifts to
      the nation&mdash;this was the practical thought of her that riveted and
      held.
    </p>
    <p>
      As has been said, they were in two groups, the children; a boy and girl in
      each. The four were of nearly the same age; but the faces of two were on a
      dimmer card in an older frame. You glanced at her again and persuaded
      yourself that the expression of motherhood which characterized her
      separated into two expressions (as behind a thin white cloud it is
      possible to watch another cloud of darker hue). Nearer in time was the
      countenance of a mother happy with happy offspring; further away the same
      countenance withdrawn a little into shadow&mdash;the face of the mother
      bereaved&mdash;mute and changeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, the worker, whom this little flock of wife and two surviving
      children now followed through the world as their leader, sat with his face
      toward his desk In a corner of the room; solidly squared before his
      undertaking, liking it, mastering it; seldom changing his position as the
      minutes passed, never nervously; with a quietude in him that was oftener
      in Southern gentlemen in quieter, more gentlemanly times. A low powerful
      figure with a pair of thick shoulders and tremendous limbs; filling the
      room with his vitality as a heavy passionate animal lying in a corner of a
      cage fills the space of the cage, so that you wait for it to roll over or
      get up on its feet and walk about that you may study its markings and get
      an inkling of its conquering nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime there were hints of him. When he had come in, he had thrown his
      overcoat on a chair that stood near the table in the centre of the room
      and had dropped his hat upon his coat. It had slipped to the floor and now
      lay there&mdash;a low, soft black hat of a kind formerly much worn by
      young Southerners of the countryside,&mdash;especially on occasions when
      there was a spur of heat in their mood and going,&mdash;much the same kind
      that one sees on the heads of students in Rome in winter; light, warm,
      shaping itself readily to breezes from any quarter, to be doffed or donned
      as comfortable and negligible. It suggested that he had been a country boy
      in the land, still belonged to the land, and as a man kept to its
      out-of-door habits and fashions. His shoes, one of which you saw at each
      side of his chair, were especially well made for rough-going feet to tramp
      in during all weathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sack suit of dark blue serge somehow helped to withdraw your
      interpretation of him from farm life to the arts or the professions. The
      scrupulous air of his shirt collar, showing against the clear-hued flesh
      at the back of his neck, and the Van Dyck-like edge of the shirt cuff,
      defining his powerful wrist and hand, strengthened the notion that he
      belonged to the arts or to the professions. He might have been sitting
      before a canvas instead of a desk and holding a brush instead of a pen:
      the picture would have been true to life. Or truer yet, he might have
      taken his place with the grave group of students in the Lesson in Anatomy
      left by Rembrandt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he put down his pen, wheeled his chair about, and began to read the
      page he had just finished: then you saw him. He had a big, masculine,
      solid-cut, self-respecting, normal-looking, executive head&mdash;covered
      with thick yellowish hair clipped short; so that while everything else in
      his appearance indicated that he was in the prime of manhood, the clipped
      hair caused him to appear still more youthful; and it invested him with a
      rustic atmosphere which went along very naturally with the sentimental
      country hat and the all-weather shoes. He seemed at first impression a
      magnificent animal frankly loved of the sun&mdash;perhaps too warmly. The
      sun itself seemed to have colored for him his beard and mustache&mdash;a
      characteristic hue of men&rsquo;s hair and beard in this land peopled from Old
      English stock. The beard, like the hair, was cut short, as though his idea
      might have been to get both hair and beard out of life&rsquo;s daily way; but
      his mustache curled thickly down over his mouth, hiding it. In the whole
      effect there was a suggestion of the Continent, perhaps of a former
      student career in Germany, memories of which may still have lasted with
      him and the marks of which may have purposely been kept up in his
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But such a fashion of beard, while covering a man&rsquo;s face, does much to
      uncover the man. As he sat amid his papers and books, your thought surely
      led again to old pictures where earnest heads bend together over some
      point on the human road, at which knowledge widens and suffering begins to
      be made more bearable and death more kind. Perforce now you interpreted
      him and fixed his general working category: that he was absorbed in work
      meant to be serviceable to humanity. His house, the members of his family,
      the people of his neighborhood, were meantime forgotten: he was not a mere
      dweller on his farm; he was a discoverer on the wide commons where the
      race forever camps at large with its problems, joys, and sorrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read his page, his hand dropped to his knee, his mind dropped its
      responsibility; one of those intervals followed when the brain rests. The
      look of the student left his face; over it began to play the soft lights
      of the domestic affections. He had forgotten the world for his own place
      in the world; the student had become the husband and house-father. A few
      moments only; then he wheeled gravely to his work again, his right hand
      took up the pen, his left hand went back to the pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence of the room seemed a guarded silence, as though he were being
      watched over by a love which would not let him be disturbed. (He had the
      reposeful self-assurance of a man who is conscious that he is idolized.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Matching the silence within was the stillness out of doors. An immense oak
      tree stood just outside the windows. It was a perpetual reminder of
      vanished woods; and when a windstorm tossed and twisted it, the straining
      and grinding of the fibres were like struggles and outcries for the wild
      life of old. This afternoon it brooded motionless, an image of forest
      reflection. Once a small black-and-white sapsucker, circling the trunk and
      peering into the crevices of the bark on a level with the windows, uttered
      minute notes which penetrated into the room like steel darts of sound. A
      snowbird alighted on the window-sill, glanced familiarly in at the man,
      and shot up its crest; but disappointed perhaps that it was not noticed,
      quoted its resigned gray phrase&mdash;a phrase it had made for itself to
      accompany the score of gray whiter&mdash;and flitted on billowy wings to a
      juniper at the corner of the house, its turret against the long javelins
      of the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the stillness of Nature outside and the house-silence of a love
      guarding him within, the man worked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little clock ticked independently on the old-fashioned Parian marble
      mantelpiece. Prints were propped against its sides and face, illustrating
      the use of trees about ancient tombs and temples. Out of this photographic
      grove of dead things the uncaring clock threw out upon the air a living
      three&mdash;the fateful three that had been measured for each tomb and
      temple in its own land and time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock, regretful but positive, was heard, and the door opening into the
      hall was quietly pushed open. A glow lit up the student&rsquo;s face though he
      did not stop writing; and his voice, while it gave a welcome,
      unconsciously expressed regret at being disturbed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his heavy figure with instant courtesy&mdash;rather obsolete now&mdash;and
      bowing to one side, sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; he said, dipping his pen into his ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you did not turn around, you would better have said &lsquo;So I hear.&rsquo; It
      is three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you would be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you would be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am done&mdash;nearly done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nearly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow afternoon before dark. I have reached the
      end, but now it is hard to stop, hard to let go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone gave first place, primary consideration, to his work. The silence
      in the room suddenly became charged. When the voice was heard again, there
      was constraint in it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something to be done this afternoon before dark, something I
      have a share in. Having a share, I am interested. Being interested, I am
      prompt. Being prompt, I am here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand over the written sheets before him&mdash;those cold Alps
      of learning; and asked reproachfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not interested in all this, O you of little faith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I say, O me of little knowledge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the words impulsively escaped, he heard a quick movement behind him. He
      widened out his heavy arms upon his manuscript and looked back over his
      shoulder at her and laughed. And still smiling and holding his pen between
      his fingers, he turned and faced her. She had advanced into the middle of
      the room and had stopped at the chair on which he had thrown his overcoat
      and hat. She had picked up the hat and stood turning it and pushing its
      soft material back into shape for his head&mdash;without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The northern light of the winter afternoon, entering through the looped
      crimson-damask curtains, fell sidewise upon the woman of the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years had passed since the picture had been made. There were changes in
      her; she looked younger. She had effaced the ravages of a sadder period of
      her life as human voyagers upon reaching quiet port repair the damages of
      wandering and storm. Even the look of motherhood, of the two motherhoods,
      which so characterized her in the photograph, had disappeared for the
      present. Seeing her now for the first time, one would have said that her
      whole mood and bearing made a single declaration: she was neither wife nor
      mother; she was a woman in love with life&rsquo;s youth&mdash;with youth&mdash;youth;
      in love with the things that youth alone could ever secure to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage of her beautiful head, brave and buoyant, brought before you
      a vision of growing things in nature as they move towards their summer yet
      far away. There still was youth in the round white throat above the collar
      of green velvet&mdash;woodland green&mdash;darker than the green of the
      cloth she wore. You were glad she had chosen that color because she was
      going for a walk with him; and green would enchain the eye out on the sere
      ground and under the stripped trees. The flecklessness of her long gloves
      drew your thoughts to winter rather&mdash;to its one beauteous gift
      dropped from soiled clouds. A slender toque brought out the keenness in
      the oval of her face. From it rose one backward-sweeping feather of green
      shaded to coral at the tip; and there your fancy may have cared to see
      lingering the last radiance of whiter-sunset skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his seat with his back to the manuscript from which he had
      repulsed her; and his eyes swept loyally over her as she waited. Though
      she could scarcely trust herself to speak, still less could she endure the
      silence. With her face turned toward the windows opening on the lawn, she
      stretched out her arm toward him and softly shook his hat at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun sets&mdash;you remember how many minutes after four,&rdquo; she said,
      with no other tone than that of quiet warning. &ldquo;I marked the minutes in
      the almanac for you the other night after the children had gone to bed, so
      that you would not forget. You know how short the twilights are even when
      the day is clear. It is cloudy to-day and there will not be any twilight.
      The children said they would not be at home until after dark, but they may
      come sooner; it may be a trick. They have threatened to catch us this year
      in one way or another, and you know they must not do that&mdash;not this
      year! There must be one more Christmas with all its old ways&mdash;even if
      it must be without its old mysteries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply at once and then not relevantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you playing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had dropped his head forward and was scowling at her from under his
      brows with a big Beethoven brooding scowl. She did not see, for she held
      her face averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence in the room again seemed charged, and there was greater
      constraint in her voice when it was next heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to play; you need not have listened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to listen; you played loud&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know I was playing loud. I may have been trying to drown other
      sounds,&rdquo; she admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other sounds?&rdquo; His voice unexpectedly became inquisitorial: it was a
      frank thrust into the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Discords&mdash;possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What discords?&rdquo; His thrust became deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head quickly and looked at him; a quiver passed across her
      lips and in her eyes there was noble anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing so arrests our speech when we are tempted to betray hidden
      trouble as to find ourselves face to face with a kind of burnished,
      radiant happiness. Sensitive eyes not more quickly close before a blaze of
      sunlight than the shadowy soul shuts her gates upon the advancing Figure
      of Joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the whole familiar picture of him now&mdash;triumphantly painted in
      the harmonies of life, masterfully toned to subdue its discords&mdash;that
      drove her back into herself. When she spoke next, she had regained the
      self-control which under his unexpected attack she had come near losing;
      and her words issued from behind the closed gates&mdash;as through a
      crevice of the closed gates:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was reading one of the new books that came the other day, the deep
      grave ones you sent for. It is written by a deep grave German, and it is
      worked out in the deep grave German way. The whole purpose of it is to
      show that any woman in the life of any man is merely&mdash;an Incident.
      She may be this to him, she may be that to him; for a briefer time, for a
      greater time; but all along and in the end, at bottom, she is to him&mdash;an
      Incident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not take his eyes from hers and his smile slowly broadened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were those the discords?&rdquo; he asked gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned in his chair and looking over his shoulder at her, he raised his
      arm and drew the point of his pen across the backs of a stack of magazines
      on top of his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a work,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not written by a German or by any other man,
      but by a woman whose race I do not know: here is a work the sole purpose
      of which is to prove that any man is merely an Incident in the life of any
      woman. He may be this to her, he may be that to her; for a briefer time,
      for a greater time; but all along and in the end, beneath everything else,
      he is to her&mdash;an Incident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and confronted her, not without a gleam of humor in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That did not trouble me,&rdquo; he said tenderly. &ldquo;Those were not discords to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes rested on his face with inscrutable searching. She made no
      comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own face grew grave. After a moment of debate with himself as to
      whether he should be forced to do a thing he would rather not do, he
      turned in his chair and laid down his pen as though separating himself
      from his work. Then he said, in a tone that ended playfulness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I not understand? Have I not understood all the time? For a year now I
      have been shutting myself up at spare hours in this room and at this work&mdash;without
      any explanation to you. Such a thing never occurred before in our lives.
      You have shared everything. I have relied upon you and I have needed you,
      and you have never failed me. And this apparently has been your reward&mdash;to
      be rudely shut out at last. Now you come in and I tell you that the work
      is done&mdash;quite finished&mdash;without a word to you about it. Do I
      not understand?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Have I not understood all along? It is
      true; outwardly as regards this work you have been&mdash;the Incident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he paused, she made a slight gesture with one hand as though she did
      not care for what he was saying and brushed away the fragile web of his
      words from before her eyes&mdash;eyes fixed on larger things lying clear
      before her in life&rsquo;s distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went quickly on with deepening emphasis:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, comrade of all these years, battler with me for life&rsquo;s victories,
      did you think you were never to know? Did you believe I was never to
      explain? You had only one more day to wait! If patience, if faith, could
      only have lasted another twenty-four hours&mdash;until Christmas Eve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time for nearly a year that the sound of those words had
      been heard in that house. He bent earnestly over toward her; he leaned
      heavily forward with his hands on his knees and searched her features with
      loyal chiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has not Christmas Eve its mysteries?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;its secrets for you and
      me? Think of Christmas Eve for you and me! Remember!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly as in a windless woods on a winter day a smoke from a woodchopper&rsquo;s
      smouldering fire will wander off and wind itself about the hidden
      life-buds of a young tree, muffling it while the atmosphere near by is
      clear, there now floated into the room to her the tender haze of old
      pledges and vows and of things unutterably sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noted the effect of his words and did not wait. He turned to his desk
      and, gathering up the sprigs of holly and cedar, began softly to cover her
      picture with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay blinded and bewildered there,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;until the hour comes when
      holly and cedar will speak: on Christmas Eve you will understand; you will
      then see whether in this work you have been&mdash;the Incident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even while they had been talking the light of the short winter afternoon
      had perceptibly waned in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced through the windows at the darkening lawn; her eyes were
      tear-dimmed; to her it looked darker than it was. She held his hat up
      between her arms, making an arch for him to come and stand under.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is getting late,&rdquo; she said in nearly the same tone of quiet warning
      with which she had spoken before. &ldquo;There is no time to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang up, without glancing behind him at his desk with its interrupted
      work, and came over and placed himself under the arch of her arms, looking
      at her reverently.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his hands did not take hold, his arms hung down at his sides&mdash;the
      hands that were life, the arms that were love.
    </p>
    <p>
      She let her eyes wander over his clipped tawny hair and pass downward over
      his features to the well-remembered mouth under its mustache. Then,
      closing her quivering lips quickly, she dropped the hat softly on his head
      and walked toward the door. When she reached it, she put out one of her
      hands delicately against a panel and turned her profile over her shoulder
      to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what is the trouble with both of those books?&rdquo; she asked,
      with a struggling sweetness in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had caught up his overcoat and as he put one arm through the sleeve
      with a vigorous thrust, he laughed out with his mouth behind the collar:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know what is the trouble with the authors of the books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;the trouble is that the authors are right
      and the books are right: men and women <i>are</i> only Incidents to each
      other in life,&rdquo; and she passed out into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Human life itself for that matter is only an incident in the universe,&rdquo;
       he replied, &ldquo;if we cared to look at it in that way; but we&rsquo;d better not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was standing near the table in the middle of the room; he suddenly
      stopped buttoning his overcoat. His eyes began to wander over the books,
      the prints, the pictures, embracing in a final survey everything that he
      had brought together from such distances of place and time. His work was
      in effect done. A sense of regret, a rush of loneliness, came over him as
      it comes upon all of us who reach the happy ending of toil that we have
      put our heart and strength in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming?&rdquo; she called faintly from the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming,&rdquo; he replied, and moved toward the door; but there he stopped
      again and looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more there came into his face the devotion of the student; he was on
      the commons where the race encamps; he was brother to all brothers who
      join work to work for common good. He was feeling for the moment that
      through his hands ran the long rope of the world at which men&mdash;like a
      crew of sailors&mdash;tug at the Ship of Life, trying to tow her into some
      divine haven.
    </p>
    <p>
      His task was ended. Would it be of service? Would it carry any message?
      Would it kindle in American homes some new light of truth, with the eyes
      of mothers and fathers fixed upon it, and innumerable children of the
      future the better for its shining?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming?&rdquo; she called more quiveringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming,&rdquo; he called back, breaking away from his revery, and raising
      his voice so it would surely reach her.

      II. THE TREE AND THE SUNSET
    </h2>
    <p>
      She had quitted the house and, having taken a few steps across the short
      frozen grass of the yard as one walks lingeringly when expecting to be
      joined by a companion, she turned and stood with her eyes fixed on the
      doorway for his emerging figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow night,&rdquo; he had said, smiling at her with one meaning in his
      words, &ldquo;to-morrow night you will understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she now said to herself, with another meaning in hers, &ldquo;to-morrow
      night I must understand. Until to-morrow night, then, blinded and
      bewildered with holly and cedar let me be! Kind ignorance, enfold me and
      spare me! All happiness that I can control or conjecture, come to me and
      console me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And over herself she dropped a vesture of joy to greet him when he should
      step forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pleasant afternoon to be out of doors and to go about what they
      had planned; the ground was scarcely frozen, there was no wind, and the
      whole sky was overcast with thin gray cloud that betrayed no movement.
      Under this still dome of silvery-violet light stretched the winter land;
      it seemed ready and waiting for its great festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawn sloped away from the house to a brook at the bottom, and beyond
      the brook the ground rose to a woodland hilltop. Across the distance you
      distinguished there the familiar trees of blue-grass pastures: white ash
      and black ash; white oak and red oak; white walnut and black walnut; and
      the scaly-bark hickory in his roughness and the sycamore with her soft
      leoparded limbs. The black walnut and the hickory brought to mind autumn
      days when children were abroad, ploughing the myriad leaves with booted
      feet and gathering their harvest of nuts&mdash;primitive food-storing
      instinct of the human animal still rampant in modern childhood: these nuts
      to be put away in garret and cellar and but scantily eaten until Christmas
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of this woods on the afternoon air sounded the muffled strokes of an
      axe cutting down a black walnut partly dead; and when this fell, it would
      bring down with it bunches of mistletoe, those white pearls of the forest
      mounted on branching jade. To-morrow eager fingers would be gathering the
      mistletoe to decorate the house. Near by was a thicket of bramble and cane
      where, out of reach of cattle, bushes of holly thrived: the same fingers
      would be gathering that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bordering this woods on one side lay a cornfield. The corn had just been
      shucked, and beside each shock of fodder lay its heap of ears ready for
      the gathering wagon. The sight of the corn brought freshly to remembrance
      the red-ambered home-brew of the land which runs in a genial torrent
      through all days and nights of the year&mdash;many a full-throated rill&mdash;but
      never with so inundating a movement as at this season. And the same grain
      suggested also the smokehouses of all farms, in which larded porkers,
      fattened by it, had taken on posthumous honors as home-cured hams; and in
      which up under the black rafters home-made sausages were being smoked to
      their needed flavor over well-chosen chips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around one heap of ears a flock of home-grown turkeys, red-mottled,
      rainbow-necked, were feeding for their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the woods stretched a wheat-field, in the stubble of
      which coveys of bob-whites were giving themselves final plumpness for the
      table by picking up grains of wheat which had dropped into the drills at
      harvest time or other seeds which had ripened in the autumn aftermath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farther away on the landscape there was a hemp-field where hemp-breakers
      were making a rattling reedy music; during these weeks wagons loaded with
      the gold-bearing fibre begin to move creaking to the towns, helping to
      fill the farmer&rsquo;s pockets with holiday largess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus everything needed for Christmas was there in sight: the mistletoe&mdash;the
      holly&mdash;the liquor of the land for the cups of hearty men&mdash;the
      hams and the sausages of fastidious housewives&mdash;the turkey and the
      quail&mdash;and crops transmutable into coin. They were in sight there&mdash;the
      fair maturings of the sun now ready to be turned into offerings to the
      dark solstice, the low activities of the soil uplifted to human joyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One last thing completed the picture of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brook that wound across the lawn at its bottom was frozen to-day and
      lay like a band of jewelled samite trailed through the olive verdure.
      Along its margin evergreens grew. No pine nor spruce nor larch nor fir is
      native to these portions of the Shield; only the wild cedar, the shapeless
      and the shapely, belongs there. This assemblage of evergreens was not,
      then, one of the bounties of Nature; they had been planted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the slender tapering spires of these evergreens with their note of
      deathless spring that mainly caught the eye on the whole landscape this
      dead winter day. Under the silvery-violet light of the sky they waited in
      beauty and in peace: the pale green of larch and spruce which seems always
      to go with the freshness of dripping Aprils; the dim blue-gray of pines
      which rather belongs to far-vaulted summer skies; and the dark green of
      firs&mdash;true comfortable winter coat when snows sift mournfully and
      icicles are spearing earthward.
    </p>
    <p>
      These evergreens likewise had their Christmas meaning and finished the
      picture of the giving earth. Unlike the other things, they satisfied no
      appetite, they were ministers to no passions; but with them the Christmas
      of the intellect began: the human heart was to drape their boughs with its
      gentle poetry; and from their ever living spires the spiritual hope of
      humanity would take its flight toward the eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus then the winter land waited for the oncoming of that strange
      travelling festival of the world which has roved into it and encamped
      gypsy-like from old lost countries: the festival that takes toll of field
      and wood, of hoof and wing, of cup and loaf; but that, best of all, wrings
      from the nature of man its reluctant tenderness for his fellows and builds
      out of his lonely doubts regarding this life his faith in a better one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And central on this whole silent scene&mdash;the highest element in it&mdash;its
      one winter-red passion flower&mdash;the motionless woman waiting outside
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he came out upon the step.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast a quick glance toward the sky as though his first thought were of
      what the weather was going to be. Then as he buttoned the top button of
      his overcoat and pressed his bearded chin down over it to make it more
      comfortable under his short neck, with his other hand he gave a little
      pull at his hat&mdash;the romantic country hat; and he peeped out from
      under the rustic brim at her, smiling with old gayeties and old
      fondnesses. He bulked so rotund inside his overcoat and looked so short
      under the flat headgear that her first thought was how slight a disguise
      every year turned him into a good family Santa Claus; and she smiled back
      at him with the same gayeties and fondnesses of days gone by. But such a
      deeper pang pierced her that she turned away and walked hurriedly down the
      hill toward the evergreens.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quickly at her side. She could feel how animal youth in him
      released itself the moment he had come into the open air. There was brutal
      vitality in the way his shoes crushed the frozen ground; and as his
      overcoat sleeve rubbed against her arm, there was the same leaping out of
      life, like the rubbing of tinder against tinder. Halfway down the lawn he
      halted and laid his hand heavily on her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to that!&rdquo; he said. His voice was eager, excited, like a boy&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the opposite side of the house, several hundred yards away, the country
      turnpike ran; and from this there now reached them the rumbling of many
      vehicles, hurrying in close procession out of the nearest town and moving
      toward smaller villages scattered over the country; to its hamlets and
      cross-roads and hundreds of homes richer or poorer&mdash;every vehicle
      Christmas-laden: sign and foretoken of the Southern Yule-tide. There were
      matters and usages in those American carriages and buggies and wagons and
      carts the history of which went back to the England of the Georges and the
      Stuarts and the Henrys; to the England of Elizabeth, to the England of
      Chaucer; back through robuster Saxon times to the gaunt England of Alfred,
      and on beyond this till they were lost under the forest glooms of
      Druidical Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood looking into each other&rsquo;s eyes and gathering into their ears
      the festal uproar of the turnpike. How well they knew what it all meant&mdash;this
      far-flowing tide of bounteousness! How perfectly they saw the whole
      picture of the town out of which the vehicles had come: the atmosphere of
      it already darkened by the smoke of soft coal pouring from its chimneys,
      so that twilight in it had already begun to fall ahead of twilight out in
      the country, and lamp-posts to glimmer along the little streets, and shops
      to be illuminated to the delight of window-gazing, mystery-loving children&mdash;wild
      with their holiday excitements and secrecies. Somewhere in the throng
      their own two children were busy unless they had already started home.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years he had held a professorship in the college in this town, driving
      in and out from his home; but with the close of this academic year he was
      to join the slender file of Southern men who have been called to Northern
      universities: this change would mean the end of life here. Both thought of
      this now&mdash;of the last Christmas in the house; and with the same
      impulse they turned their gaze back to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than half a century ago the one starved genius of the Shield, a
      writer of songs, looked out upon the summer picture of this land, its
      meadows and ripening corn tops; and as one presses out the spirit of an
      entire vineyard when he bursts a solitary grape upon his tongue, he, the
      song writer, drained drop by drop the wine of that scene into the notes of
      a single melody. The nation now knows his song, the world knows it&mdash;the
      only music that has ever captured the joy and peace of American home life&mdash;embodying
      the very soul of it in the clear amber of sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      This house was one of such homesteads as the genius sang of: a low,
      old-fashioned, brown-walled, gray-shingled house; with chimneys generous,
      with green window-shutters less than green and white window-sills less
      than white; with feudal vines giving to its walls their summery
      allegiance; not young, not old, but standing in the middle years of its
      strength and its honors; not needy, not wealthy, but answering Agar&rsquo;s
      prayer for neither poverty nor riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two stood on the darkening lawn, looking back at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been the house of his fathers. He had brought her to it as his own
      on the afternoon of their wedding several miles away across the country.
      They had arrived at dark; and as she had sat beside him in the carriage,
      one of his arms around her and his other hand enfolding both of hers, she
      had first caught sight of it through the forest trees&mdash;waiting for
      her with its lights just lit, its warmth, its privacies: and that had been
      Christmas Eve!
    </p>
    <p>
      For her wedding day had been Christmas Eve. When she had announced her
      choice of a day, they had chidden her. But with girlish wilfulness she had
      clung to it the more positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the most beautiful night of the year!&rdquo; she had replied, brushing
      their objection aside with that reason alone. &ldquo;And it is the happiest! I
      will be married on that night, when I am happiest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alone and thinking it over, she had uttered other words to herself&mdash;yet
      scarce uttered them, rather felt them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of old it was written how on Christmas Night the Love that cannot fail us
      became human. My love for him, which is the divine thing in my life and
      which is never to fail him, shall become human to him on that night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the carriage had stopped at the front porch, he had led her into the
      house between the proud smiling servants of his establishment ranged at a
      respectful distance on each side; and without surrendering her even to her
      maid&mdash;a new spirit of silence on him&mdash;he had led her to her
      bedroom, to a place on the carpet under the chandelier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving her there, he had stepped backward and surveyed her waiting in her
      youth and loveliness&mdash;<i>for him;</i> come into his house, into his
      arms&mdash;<i>his</i>; no other&rsquo;s&mdash;never while life lasted to be
      another&rsquo;s even in thought or in desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then as if the marriage ceremony of the afternoon in the presence of many
      had meant nothing and this were the first moment when he could gather her
      home to him, he had come forward and taken her in his arms and set upon
      her the kiss of his house and his ardor and his duty. As his warm breath
      broke close against her face, his lips under their mustache, almost boyish
      then, had thoughtlessly formed one little phrase&mdash;one little but most
      lasting and fateful phrase:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Bride of the Mistletoe</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking up with a smile, she saw that she stood under a bunch of mistletoe
      swung from the chandelier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Straightway he had forgotten his own words, nor did he ever afterwards
      know that he had used them. But she, out of their very sacredness as the
      first words he had spoken to her in his home, had remembered them most
      clingingly. More than remembered them: she had set them to grow down into
      the fibres of her heart as the mistletoe roots itself upon the life-sap of
      the tree. And in all the later years they had been the green spot of
      verdure under life&rsquo;s dark skies&mdash;the undying bough into which the
      spirit of the whole tree retreats from the ice of the world:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Bride of the Mistletoe!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the first problem of learning to weld her nature to his wisely;
      through the perils of bearing children and the agony of seeing some of
      them pass away; through the ambition of having him rise in his profession
      and through the ideal of making his home an earthly paradise; through
      loneliness when he was away and joy whenever he came back,&mdash;upon her
      whole life had rested the wintry benediction of that mystical phrase:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Bride of the Mistletoe!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away now, starting once more downward toward the evergreens. He
      was quickly at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose Harold and Elizabeth are up to about this time?&rdquo; he
      asked, with a good-humored jerk of his head toward the distant town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least to something mischievous, whatever it is,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;They
      begged to be allowed to stay until the shop windows were lighted; they
      have seen the shop windows two or three times already this week: there is
      no great marvel for them now in shop windows. Permission to stay late may
      be a blind to come home early. They are determined, from what I have
      overheard, to put an end this year to the parental house mysteries of
      Christmas. They are crossing the boundary between the first childhood and
      the second. But if it be possible, I wish everything to be kept once more
      just as it has always been; let it be so for my sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I wish it for your sake,&rdquo; he replied heartily; &ldquo;and for my purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment of silence he asked: &ldquo;How large a Tree must it be this
      year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will have to be large,&rdquo; she replied; and she began to count those for
      whom the Tree this year was meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      First she called the names of the two children they had lost. Gifts for
      these were every year hung on the boughs. She mentioned their names now,
      and then she continued counting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harold and Elizabeth are four. You and I make six. After the family come
      Herbert and Elsie, your best friend the doctor&rsquo;s children. Then the
      servants&mdash;long strong bottom branches for the servants! Allow for the
      other children who are to make up the Christmas party: ten children have
      been invited, ten children have accepted, ten children will arrive. The
      ten will bring with them some unimportant parents; you can judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do for size,&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;Now the kind: spruce&mdash;larch&mdash;hemlock&mdash;pine&mdash;which
      shall it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be none of them!&rdquo; she answered, after a little waiting. &ldquo;It
      shall be the Christmas Tree of the uttermost North where the reindeer are
      harnessed and the Great White Sleigh starts&mdash;fir. The old Christmas
      stories like fir best. Old faiths seem to lodge in it longest. And deepest
      mystery darkens the heart of it,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fir it shall be!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Choose the tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have chosen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and delicately touched his wrist with the finger tips of one
      white-gloved hand, bidding him stand beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That one,&rdquo; she said, pointing down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brook, watering the roots of the evergreens in summer gratefully, but
      now lying like a band of samite, jewel-crusted, made a loop near the
      middle point of the lawn, creating a tiny island; and on this island,
      aloof from its fellows and with space for the growth of its boughs, stood
      a perfect fir tree: strong-based, thick-set, tapering faultlessly,
      star-pointed, gathering more youth as it gathered more years&mdash;a tame
      dweller on the lawn but descended from forests blurred with wildness and
      lapped by low washings of the planet&rsquo;s primeval ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      At each Christmas for several years they had been tempted to cut this
      tree, but had spared it for its conspicuous beauty at the edge of the
      thicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That one,&rdquo; she now said, pointing down. &ldquo;This is the last time. Let us
      have the best of things while we may! Is it not always the perfect that is
      demanded for sacrifice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His glance had already gone forward eagerly to the tree, and he started
      toward it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descending, they stepped across the brook to the island and went up close
      to the fir. With a movement not unobserved by her he held out his hand and
      clasped three green fingers of a low bough which the fir seemed to stretch
      out to him recognizingly. (She had always realized the existence of some
      intimate bond between him and the forest.) His face now filled with
      meanings she did not share; the spell of the secret work had followed him
      out of the house down to the trees; incommunicable silence shut him in. A
      moment later his fingers parted with the green fingers of the fir and he
      moved away from her side, starting around the tree and studying it as
      though in delight of fresh knowledge. So she watched him pass around to
      the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came back where he had started, she was not there. He looked
      around searchingly; her figure was nowhere in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood&mdash;waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley had memories, what memories! The years came close together
      here; they clustered as thickly as the trees themselves. Vacant spots
      among them marked where the Christmas Trees of former years had been cut
      down. Some of the Trees had been for the two children they had lost. This
      wandering trail led hither and thither back to the first Tree for the
      first child: he had stooped down and cut that close to the ground with his
      mere penknife. When it had been lighted, it had held only two or three
      candles; and the candle on the top of it had flared level into the
      infant&rsquo;s hand-shaded eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that she was making through the evergreens a Pilgrimage of the
      Years, walking there softly and alone with the feet of life&rsquo;s Pities and a
      mother&rsquo;s Constancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for her&mdash;motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stillness of the twilight rested on the valley now. Only from the
      trees came the plaintive twittering of birds which had come in from frozen
      weeds and fence-rows and at the thresholds of the boughs were calling to
      one another. It was not their song, but their speech; there was no love in
      it, but there was what for them perhaps corresponds to our sense of ties.
      It most resembled in human life the brief things that two people, having
      long lived together, utter to each other when together in a room they
      prepare for the night: there is no anticipation; it is a confession of the
      unconfessed. About him now sounded this low winter music from the far
      boundary of other lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light on the landscape had changed. The sun was setting and a splendor
      began to spread along the sky and across the land. It laid a glory on the
      roof of the house on the hill; it smote the edge of the woodland pasture,
      burnishing with copper the gray domes; it shone faintly on distant corn
      shocks, on the weather-dark tents of the hemp at bivouac soldierly and
      grim. At his feet it sparkled in rose gleams on the samite of the brook
      and threw burning shafts into the gloom of the fir beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not hear the calling of the birds about his ears, he did not see
      the sunset before his eyes, he did not feel the fir tree the boughs of
      which stuck against his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there as still as a rock&mdash;with his secret. Not the secret of
      the year&rsquo;s work, which was to be divulged to his wife and through her to
      the world; but the secret which for some years had been growing in his
      life and which would, he hoped, never grow into the open&mdash;to be seen
      of her and of all men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentimental country hat now looked as though it might have been worn
      purposely to help out a disguise, as the more troubled man behind the
      scenes makes up to be the happier clown. It became an absurdity, a
      mockery, above his face grave, stern, set of jaw and eye. He was no longer
      the student buried among his books nor human brother to toiling brothers.
      He had not the slightest thought of service to mankind left in him, he was
      but a man himself with enough to think of in the battle between his own
      will and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      And behind him among the dark evergreens went on that Pilgrimage of the
      Years&mdash;with the feet of the Pities and the Constancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moments passed; he did not stir. Then there was a slight noise on the
      other side of the tree, and his nature instantly stepped back into his
      outward place. He looked through the boughs. She had returned and was
      standing with her face also turned toward the sunset; it was very pale,
      very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such darkness had settled on the valley now that the green she wore blent
      with the green of the fir. He saw only her white face and her white hands
      so close to the branches that they appeared to rest upon them, to grow out
      of them: he sadly thought of one of his prints of Egypt of old and of the
      Lady of the Sacred Tree. Her long backward-sweeping plume of green also
      blent with the green of the fir&mdash;shade to shade&mdash;and only the
      coral tip of it remained strongly visible. This matched the last coral in
      the sunset; and it seemed to rest ominously above her head as a
      finger-point of the fading light of Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went quickly around to her. He locked his arms around her and drew her
      close and held her close; and thus for a while the two stood, watching the
      flame on the altar of the world as it sank lower, leaving emptiness and
      ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once she put out a hand and with a gesture full of majesty and nobleness
      waved farewell to the dying fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still without a word he took his arms from around her and turned
      energetically to the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed the lowest boughs aside and made his way in close to the trunk
      and struck it with a keen stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fir as he drew the axe out made at its gashed throat a sound like that
      of a butchered, blood-strangled creature trying to cry out too late
      against a treachery. A horror ran through the boughs; the thousands of
      leaves were jarred by the death-strokes; and the top of it rocked like a
      splendid plume too rudely treated in a storm. Then it fell over on its
      side, bridging blackly the white ice of the brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping, he lifted it triumphantly. He set the butt-end on one of his
      shoulders and, stretching his arms up, grasped the trunk and held the tree
      straight in the air, so that it seemed to be growing out of his big
      shoulder as out of a ledge of rock. Then he turned to her and laughed out
      in his strength and youth. She laughed joyously back at him, glorying as
      he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a robust re-shouldering of the tree to make it more comfortable to
      carry, he turned and started up the hill toward the house. As she followed
      behind, the old mystery of the woods seemed at last to have taken bodily
      possession of him. The fir was riding on his shoulder, its arms met fondly
      around his neck, its fingers were caressing his hair. And it whispered
      back jeeringly to her through the twilight:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say farewell to him! He was once yours; he is yours no longer. He dandles
      the child of the forest on his shoulder instead of his children by you in
      the house. He belongs to Nature; and as Nature calls, he will always
      follow&mdash;though it should lead over the precipice or into the flood.
      Once Nature called him to you: remember how he broke down barriers until
      he won you. Now he is yours no longer&mdash;say good-by to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an imbued terror and desolation, she caught up with him. By a
      movement so soft that he should not be aware, she plucked him by the coat
      sleeve on the other side from the fir and held on to him as he strode on
      in careless joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halfway up the hill lights began to flash from the windows of the house: a
      servant was bringing in the lamps. It was at this hour, in just this way,
      that she had first caught sight of them on that Christmas Eve when he had
      brought her home after the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried around in front of him, wishing to read the expression of his
      eyes by the distant gleams from the windows. Would they have nothing to
      say to her about those winter twilight lamps? Did he, too, not remember?
    </p>
    <p>
      His head and face were hidden; a thousand small spears of Nature bristled
      between him and her; but he laughed out to her from behind the rampart of
      the green spears.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a low sound in the distance drew her attention, and
      instantly alert she paused to listen. Then, forgetting everything else,
      she called to him with a rush of laughter like that of her mischief-loving
      girlhood:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! There they are! I heard the gate shut at the turnpike! They must
      not catch us! Quick! Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry, then!&rdquo; he cried, as he ran forward, joining his laughter to hers.
      &ldquo;Open the door for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this the night fell fast. The only sounds to be heard in the valley
      were the minute readjustments of the ice of the brook as it froze tighter
      and the distressed cries of the birds that had roosted in the fir.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Tree entered the house.

      III. THE LIGHTING OF THE CANDLES
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the night it turned bitter cold. When morning came the sky was a
      turquoise and the wind a gale. The sun seemed to give out light but not
      heat&mdash;to lavish its splendor but withhold its charity. Moist flesh if
      it chanced to touch iron froze to it momentarily. So in whiter land the
      tongue of the ermine freezes to the piece of greased metal used as a trap
      and is caught and held there until the trapper returns or until it starves&mdash;starves
      with food on its tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground, wherever the stiff boots of a farmhand struck it, resisted as
      rock. In the fetlocks of farm horses, as they moved shivering, balls of
      ice rattled like shaken tacks. The little roughnesses of woodland paths
      snapped off beneath the slow-searching hoofs of fodder-seeking cattle like
      points of glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within their wool the sheep were comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      On higher fields which had given back their moisture to the atmosphere and
      now were dry, the swooping wind lifted the dust at intervals and dragged
      it away in flaunting yellow veils. The picture it made, being so
      ill-seasoned, led you to think of August drought when the grasshopper
      stills itself in the weeds and the smell of grass is hot in the nostrils
      and every bird holds its beak open and its wings lifted like cooling
      lattices alongside its breast. In these veils of dust swarms of frost
      crystals sported&mdash;dead midgets of the dead North. Except crystal and
      dust and wind, naught moved out there; no field mouse, no hare nor lark
      nor little shielded dove. In the naked trees of the pasture the crow kept
      his beak as unseen as the owl&rsquo;s; about the cedars of the yard no scarlet
      feather warmed the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house on the hill&mdash;one of the houses whose spirit had been blown
      into the amber of the poet&rsquo;s song&mdash;sent festal smoke out of its
      chimneys all day long. At intervals the radiant faces of children appeared
      at the windows, hanging wreaths of evergreens; or their figures flitted to
      and fro within as they wove garlands on the walls for the Christmas party.
      At intervals some servant with head and shoulders muffled in a
      bright-colored shawl darted trippingly from the house to the cabins in the
      yard and from the cabins back to the house&mdash;the tropical African&rsquo;s
      polar dance between fire and fire. By every sign it gave the house showed
      that it was marshalling its whole happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing only seemed to make a signal of distress from afar. The oak tree
      beside the house, whose roots coiled warmly under the hearth-stones and
      whose boughs were outstretched across the roof, seemed to writhe and rock
      in its winter sleep with murmurings and tossings like a human dreamer
      trying to get rid of an unhappy dream. Imagination might have said that
      some darkest tragedy of forests long since gone still lived in this lone
      survivor&mdash;that it struggled to give up the grief and guilt of an
      ancient forest shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather moderated in the afternoon. A warm current swept across the
      upper atmosphere, developing everywhere behind it a cloud; and toward
      sundown out of this cloud down upon the Shield snow began to fall. Not the
      large wet flakes which sometimes descend too late in spring upon the buds
      of apple orchards; nor those mournfuller ones which drop too soon on dim
      wild violets in November woods, but winter snow, stern sculptor of Arctic
      solitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Christmas Eve. It was snowing all over the Shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Softly the snow fell upon the year&rsquo;s footprints and pathways of children
      and upon schoolhouses now closed and riotously deserted. More softly upon
      too crowded asylums for them: houses of noonday darkness where eyes
      eagerly look out at the windows but do not see; houses of soundlessness
      where ears listen and do not hear any noise; houses of silence where lips
      try to speak but utter no word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snow of Christmas Eve was falling softly on the old: whose eyes are
      always seeing vanished faces, whose ears hear voices gentler than any the
      earth now knows, whose hands forever try to reach other hands vainly held
      out to them. Sad, sad to those who remember loved ones gone with their
      kindnesses the snow of Christmas Eve!
    </p>
    <p>
      But sadder yet for those who live on together after kindnesses have
      ceased, or whose love went like a summer wind. Sad is Christmas Eve to
      them! Dark its snow and blinding!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came into the parlor, clasping the bowl of a shaded lamp&mdash;the
      only light in the room. Her face, always calm in life&rsquo;s wisdom, but
      agitated now by the tide of deep things coming swiftly in toward her,
      rested clear-cut upon the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed the lamp on a table near the door and seated herself beside it.
      But she pushed the lamp away unconsciously as though the light of the
      house were no longer her light; and she sat in the chair as though it were
      no longer her chair; and she looked about the room as though it were no
      longer hers nor the house itself nor anything else that she cared for
      most.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier in the evening they had finished hanging the presents on the Tree;
      but then an interruption had followed: the children had broken profanely
      in upon them, rending the veil of the house mysteries; and for more than
      an hour the night had been given up to them. Now the children were asleep
      upstairs, already dreaming of Christmas Morn and the rush for the
      stockings. The servants had finished their work and were gone to their
      quarters out in the yard. The doors of the house were locked. There would
      be no more intrusion now, no possible interruption; all the years were to
      meet him and her&mdash;alone. For Life is the master dramatist: when its
      hidden tragedies are ready to utter themselves, everything superfluous
      quits the stage; it is the essential two who fill it! And how little the
      rest of the world ever hears of what takes place between the two!
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while before he had left the room with the step-ladder; when he
      came back, he was to bring with him the manuscript&mdash;the silent
      snowfall of knowledge which had been deepening about him for a year. The
      time had already passed for him to return, but he did not come. Was there
      anything in the forecast of the night that made him falter? Was he
      shrinking&mdash;<i>him</i> shrink? She put away the thought as a strange
      outbreak of injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      How still it was outside the house with the snow falling! How still
      within! She began to hear the ticking of the tranquil old clock under the
      stairway out in the hall&mdash;always tranquil, always tranquil. And then
      she began to listen to the disordered strokes of her own heart&mdash;that
      red Clock in the body&rsquo;s Tower whose beats are sent outward along the
      streets and alleys of the blood; whose law it is to be alternately wound
      too fast by the fingers of Joy, too slow by the fingers of Sorrow; and
      whose fate, if it once run down, never afterwards either by Joy or Sorrow
      to be made to run again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she could hear the distant door of his study open and close and
      his steps advance along the hall. With what a splendid swing and tramp he
      brought himself toward her!&mdash;with what self-unconsciousness and
      virile strength in his feet! His steps entered and crossed his bedroom,
      entered and crossed her bedroom; and then he stood there before her in the
      parlor doorway, a few yards off&mdash;stopped and regarded her intently,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment she realized what had delayed him. When he had gone away with
      the step-ladder, he had on a well-worn suit in which, behind locked doors,
      he had been working all the afternoon at the decorations of the Tree. Now
      he came back ceremoniously dressed; the rest of the night was to be in her
      honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had always been so on this anniversary of their bridal night. They had
      always dressed for it; the children now in their graves had been dressed
      for it; the children in bed upstairs were regularly dressed for it; the
      house was dressed for it; the servants were dressed for it; the whole life
      of that establishment had always been made to feel by honors and
      tendernesses and gayeties that this was the night on which he had married
      her and brought her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As her eyes swept over him she noted quite as never before how these
      anniversaries had not taken his youth away, but had added youth to him; he
      had grown like the evergreen in the middle of the room&mdash;with increase
      of trunk and limbs and with larger tides of strength surging through him
      toward the master sun. There were no ravages of married life in him. Time
      had merely made the tree more of a tree and made his youth more youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took in momentary details of his appearance: a moisture like summer
      heat along the edge of his yellow hair, started by the bath into which he
      had plunged; the freshness of the enormous hands holding the manuscript;
      the muscle of the forearm bulging within the dress-coat sleeve. Many a
      time she had wondered how so perfect an animal as he had ever climbed to
      such an elevation of work; and then had wondered again whether any but
      such an animal ever in life does so climb&mdash;shouldering along with him
      the poise and breadth of health and causing the hot sun of the valley to
      shine on the mountain tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally she looked to see whether he, thus dressed in her honor, thus but
      the larger youth after all their years together, would return her greeting
      with a light in his eyes that had always made them so beautiful to her&mdash;a
      light burning as at a portal opening inward for her only.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes rested on his manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought it wrapped and tied in the true holiday spirit&mdash;sprigs of
      cedar and holly caught in the ribands; and he now lifted and held it out
      to her as a jeweller might elevate a casket of gems. Then he stepped
      forward and put it on the table at her elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you!&rdquo; he said reverently, stepping back.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been years when, returning from a tramp across the country, he
      would bring her perhaps nothing but a marvellous thistle, or a brilliant
      autumn leaf for her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you!&rdquo; he would say; and then, before he could give it to her, he
      would throw it away and take her in his arms. Afterwards she would pick up
      the trifle and treasure it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you!&rdquo; he now said, offering her the treasure of his year&rsquo;s toil and
      stepping back.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the weight of the gift fell on her heart like a stone. She did not look
      at it or touch it but glanced up at him. He raised his finger, signalling
      for silence; and going to the chimney corner, brought back a long taper
      and held it over the lamp until it ignited. Then with a look which invited
      her to follow, he walked to the Tree and began to light the candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began at the lowest boughs and, passing around, touched them one by
      one. Around and around he went, and higher and higher twinkled the lights
      as they mounted the tapering sides of the fir. At the top he kindled one
      highest red star, shining down on everything below. Then he blew out the
      taper, turned out the lamp; and returning to the tree, set the heavy end
      of the taper on the floor and grasped it midway, as one might lightly hold
      a stout staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room, lighted now by the common glow of the candles, revealed itself
      to be the parlor of the house elaborately decorated for the winter
      festival. Holly wreaths hung in the windows; the walls were garlanded;
      evergreen boughs were massed above the window cornices; on the white lace
      of window curtains many-colored autumn leaves, pressed and kept for this
      night, looked as though they had been blown there scatteringly by October
      winds. The air of the room was heavy with odors; there was summer warmth
      in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the room stood the fir tree itself, with its top close to
      the ceiling and its boughs stretched toward the four walls of the room
      impartially&mdash;as symbolically to the four corners of the earth. It
      would be the only witness of all that was to take place between them: what
      better could there be than this messenger of silence and wild secrecy?
      From the mountains and valleys of the planet its race had looked out upon
      a million generations of men and women; and the calmness of its lot
      stretched across the turbulence of human passion as an ancient bridge
      spans a modern river.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the apex of the Tree a star shone. Just beneath at the first forking of
      the boughs a candle burned. A little lower down a cross gleamed. Under the
      cross a white dove hung poised, its pinions outstretched as though
      descending out of the infinite upon some earthly object below. From many
      of the branches tiny bells swung. There were little horns and little
      trumpets. Other boughs sagged under the weight of silvery cornucopias.
      Native and tropical fruits were tied on here and there; and dolls were
      tied on also with cords around their necks, their feet dangling. There
      were smiling masks, like men beheaded and smiling in their death. Near the
      base of the Tree there was a drum. And all over the Tree from pinnacle to
      base glittered a tinsel like golden fleece&mdash;looking as the moss of
      old Southern trees seen at yellow sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a while absorbed in contemplation of it. This year at his own
      request the decorations had been left wholly to him; now he seemed
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to her eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember what took place on Christmas Eve last year?&rdquo; he asked,
      with a reminiscent smile. &ldquo;You sat where you are sitting and I stood where
      I am standing. After I had finished lighting the Tree, do you remember
      what you said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment she stirred and passed her fingers across her brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recall it to me,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I must have said many things. I did not
      know that I had said anything that would be remembered a year. Recall it
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You looked at the Tree and said what a mystery it is. When and where did
      it begin, how and why?&mdash;this Tree that is now nourished in the
      affections of the human family round the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I remember that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I resolved to find out for you. I determined to prepare during what hours
      I could spare from my regular college work the gratification of your wish
      for you as a gift from me. If I could myself find the way back through the
      labyrinth of ages, then I would return for you and lead you back through
      the story of the Christmas Tree as that story has never been seen by any
      one else. All this year&rsquo;s work, then, has been the threading of the
      labyrinth. Now Christmas Eve has come again, my work is finished, my gift
      to you is ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made this announcement and stopped, leaving it to clear the air of
      mystery&mdash;the mystery of the secret work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he resumed: &ldquo;Have you, then, been the Incident in this toil as
      yesterday you intimated that you were? Do you now see that you have been
      the whole reason of it? You were excluded from any share in the work only
      because you could not help to prepare your own gift! That is all. What has
      looked like a secret in this house has been no secret. You are blinded and
      bewildered no longer; the hour has come when holly and cedar can speak for
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sunlight broke out all over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply but said within herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no! That is not the trouble. That has nothing to do with the trouble.
      The secret of the house is not a misunderstanding; it is life. It is not
      the doing of a year; it is the undoing of the years. It is not a gift to
      enrich me with new happiness; it is a lesson that leaves me poorer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on without pausing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is already late. The children interrupted us and took up part of your
      evening. But it is not too late for me to present to you some little part
      of your gift. I am going to arrange for you a short story out of the long
      one. The whole long story is there,&rdquo; he added, directing his eyes toward
      the manuscript at her elbow; and his voice showed how he felt a scholar&rsquo;s
      pride in it. &ldquo;From you it can pass out to the world that celebrates
      Christmas and that often perhaps asks the same question: What is the
      history of the Christmas Tree? But now my story for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; she said, rising. She left the package where it was; and
      with feet that trembled against the soft carpet crossed the room and
      seated herself at one end of a deep sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gathering her dignity about her, she took there the posture of a listener&mdash;listening
      at her ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sofa was of richly carved mahogany. Each end curved into a scroll like
      a landward wave of the sea. One of her foam-white arms rested on one of
      the scrolls. Her elbow, reaching beyond, touched a small table on which
      stood a vase of white frosted glass; over the rim of it profuse crimson
      carnations hung their heads. They were one of her favorite winter flowers,
      and he had had these sent out to her this afternoon from a hothouse of the
      distant town by a half-frozen messenger. Near her head curtains of crimson
      brocade swept down the wall to the floor from the golden-lustred window
      cornices. At her back were cushions of crimson silk. At the other end of
      the sofa her piano stood and on it lay the music she played of evenings to
      him, or played with thoughts of him when she was alone. And other music
      also which she many a time read; as Beethoven&rsquo;s Great Nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, along this wall of the parlor from window curtain to window curtain
      there stretched a festoon of evergreens and ribands put there by the
      children for their Christmas-Night party; and into this festoon they had
      fastened bunches of mistletoe, plucked from the walnut tree felled the day
      before&mdash;they knowing nothing, happy children!
    </p>
    <p>
      There she reclined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lower outlines of her figure were lost in a rich blackness over which
      points of jet flashed like swarms of silvery fireflies in some too warm a
      night of the warm South. The blackness of her hair and the blackness of
      her brows contrasted with the whiteness of her bare arms and shoulders and
      faultless neck and faultless throat bared also. Not far away was hid the
      warm foam-white thigh, curved like Venus&rsquo;s of old out of the sea&rsquo;s
      inaccessible purity. About her wrists garlands of old family corals were
      clasped&mdash;the ocean&rsquo;s roses; and on her breast, between the night of
      her gown and the dawn of the flesh, coral buds flowered in beauty that
      could never be opened, never be rifled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had crossed the room to the sofa, two aged house-dogs&mdash;setters
      with gentle eyes and gentle ears and gentle breeding&mdash;had followed
      her and lain down at her feet; and one with a thrust of his nose pushed
      her skirts back from the toe of her slipper and rested his chin on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will listen,&rdquo; she said, shrinking as yet from other speech. &ldquo;I wish
      simply to listen. There will be time enough afterwards for what I have to
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall go straight through,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;One minute now while I
      put together the story for you: it is hard to make a good short story out
      of so vast a one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During these moments of waiting she saw a new picture of him. Under stress
      of suffering and excitement discoveries denied to calmer hours often
      arrive. It is as though consciousness receives a shock that causes it to
      yawn and open its abysses: at the bottom we see new things: sometimes
      creating new happiness; sometimes old happiness is taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there&mdash;the man beside the Tree&mdash;into the picture
      entered three other men, looking down upon him from their portraits on the
      walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      One portrait represented the first man of his family to scale the
      mountains of the Shield where its eastern rim is turned away from the
      reddening daybreak. Thence he had forced his way to its central portions
      where the skin of ever living verdure is drawn over the rocks:
      Anglo-Saxon, backwoodsman, borderer, great forest chief, hewing and
      fighting a path toward the sunset for Anglo-Saxon women and children. With
      his passion for the wilderness&mdash;its game, enemies, campfire and
      cabin, deep-lunged freedom. This ancestor had a lonely, stern, gaunt face,
      no modern expression in it whatsoever&mdash;the timeless face of the
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near his portrait hung that of a second representative of the family. This
      man had looked out upon his vast parklike estates hi the central counties;
      and wherever his power had reached, he had used it on a great scale for
      the destruction of his forests. Woods-slayer, field-maker; working to
      bring in the period on the Shield when the hand of a man began to grasp
      the plough instead of the rifle, when the stallion had replaced the stag,
      and bellowing cattle wound fatly down into the pastures of the bison. This
      man had the face of his caste&mdash;the countenance of the Southern
      slave-holding feudal lord. Not the American face, but the Southern face of
      a definite era&mdash;less than national, less than modern; a face not
      looking far in any direction but at things close around.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a third portrait the latest ancestor looked down. He with his
      contemporaries had finished the thinning of the central forest of the
      Shield, leaving the land as it is to-day, a rolling prairie with remnants
      of woodland like that crowning the hilltop near this house. This immediate
      forefather bore the countenance that began to develop in the Northerner
      and in the Southerner after the Civil War: not the Northern look nor the
      Southern look, but the American look&mdash;a new thing in the American
      face, indefinable but unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      These three men now focussed their attention upon him, the fourth of the
      line, standing beside the tree brought into the house. Each of them in his
      own way had wrought out a work for civilization, using the woods as an
      implement. In his own case, the woods around him having disappeared, the
      ancestral passion had made him a student of forestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thesis upon which he took his degree was the relation of modern
      forestry to modern life. A few years later in an adjunct professorship his
      original researches in this field began to attract attention. These had to
      do with the South Appalachian forest in its relation to South Appalachian
      civilization and thus to that of the continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work had brought its reward; he was now to be drawn away from his own
      college and country to a Northern university.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously in him there had gone on a corresponding development of an
      ancestral face. As the look of the wilderness hunter had changed into that
      of the Southern slave-holding baron, as this had changed into the modern
      American face unlike any other; now finally in him the national American
      look had broadened into something more modern still&mdash;the look of mere
      humanity: he did not look like an American&mdash;he looked like a man in
      the service of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, which it takes thus long to recapitulate, presented itself to her as
      one wide vision of the truth. It left a realization of how the past had
      swept him along with its current; and of how the future now caught him up
      and bore him on, part in its problems. The old passion living on in him&mdash;forest
      life; a new passion born in him&mdash;human life. And by inexorable logic
      these two now blending themselves to-night in a story of the Christmas
      Tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      But womanlike she sought to pluck out of these forces something intensely
      personal to which she could cling; and she did it in this wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Spring following their marriage, often after supper they would go
      out on the lawn in the twilight, strolling among her flowers; she leading
      him this way and that way and laying upon him beautiful exactions and
      tyrannies: how he must do this and do that; and not do this and not do
      that; he receiving his orders like a grateful slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then sometimes he would silently imprison her hand and lead her down the
      lawn and up the opposite hill to the edge of the early summer evening
      woods; and there on the roots of some old tree&mdash;the shadows of the
      forest behind them and the light of the western sky in their faces&mdash;they
      would stay until darkness fell, hiding their eyes from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burning horizon became a cathedral interior&mdash;the meeting of
      love&rsquo;s holiness and the Most High; the crescent dropped a silver veil upon
      the low green hills; wild violets were at their feet; the mosses and turf
      of the Shield under them. The warmth of his body was as the day&rsquo;s sunlight
      stored in the trunk of the tree; his hair was to her like its tawny bloom,
      native to the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life with him was enchanted madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had begun. He stretched out his arm and slowly began to write on the
      air of the room. Sometimes in earlier years she had sat in his classroom
      when he was beginning a lecture; and it was thus, standing at the
      blackboard, that he sometimes put down the subject of his lecture for the
      students. Slowly now he shaped each letter and as he finished each word,
      he read it aloud to her:
    </p>

    <h2>
      IV. THE WANDERING TALE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josephine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He uttered her name with beautiful reverence, letting the sound of it
      float over the Christmas Tree and die away on the garlanded walls of the
      room: it was his last tribute to her, a dedication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josephine, sometimes while looking out of the study window a spring
      morning, I have watched you strolling among the flowers of the lawn. I
      have seen you linger near a honeysuckle in full bloom and question the
      blossoms in your questioning way&mdash;you who are always wishing to probe
      the heart of things, to drain out of them the red drop of their
      significance. But, gray-eyed querist of actuality, those fragrant trumpets
      could blow to your ear no message about their origin. It was where the
      filaments of the roots drank deepest from the mould of a dead past that
      you would have had to seek the true mouthpieces of their philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the instincts which blossom out thickly over the nature of modern man
      to themselves are mute. The flower exhibits itself at the tip of the vine;
      the instinct develops itself at the farthest outreach of life; and the
      point where it clamors for satisfaction is at the greatest possible
      distance from its birthplace. For all these instincts send their roots
      down through the mould of the uncivilized, down through the mould of the
      primitive, down into the mould of the underhuman&mdash;that ancient
      playhouse dedicated to low tragedies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While this may seem to you to be going far for a commencement of the
      story, it is coming near to us. The kind of man and woman we are to
      ourselves; the kind of husband and wife we are to each other; the kind of
      father and mother we are to our children; the kind of human beings we are
      to our fellow beings&mdash;the passions which swell as with sap the buds
      of those relations until they burst into their final shapes of conduct are
      fed from the bottom of the world&rsquo;s mould. You and I to-night are building
      the structures of our moral characters upon life-piles that sink into
      fathomless ooze. All we human beings dip our drinking cups into a vast
      delta sweeping majestically towards the sea and catch drops trickling from
      the springs of creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in a vast ancestral country, a Fatherland of Old Desire, that my
      story lies for you and for me: drawn from the forest and from human nature
      as the two have worked in the destiny of the earth. I have wrested it from
      this Tree come out of the ancient woods into the house on this Night of
      the Nativity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made the scholar&rsquo;s pause and resumed, falling into the tone of easy
      narrative. It had already become evident that this method of telling the
      story would be to find what Alpine flowers he could for her amid Alpine
      snows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her then that the oldest traceable influence in the life of the
      human race is the sea. It is true that man in some ancestral form was
      rocked in the cradle of the deep; he rose from the waves as the islanded
      Greeks said of near Venus. Traces of this origin he still bears both in
      his body and his emotions; and together they make up his first set of
      memories&mdash;Sea Memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      He deliberated a moment and then put the truth before her in a single
      picturesque phrase:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man himself is a closed living sea-shell in the chambers of which the
      hues of the first ocean are still fresh and its tempests still are
      sounding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next he told her how man&rsquo;s last marine ancestor quit one day the sea never
      again to return to the deep, crossed the sands of the beach and entered
      the forest; and how upon him, this living sea-shell, soft to impressions,
      the Spirit of the Forest fell to work, beginning to shape it over from sea
      uses to forest uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand thousand ages the Spirit of the Forest worked at the sea-shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remodelled the shell as so much clay; stood it up and twisted and
      branched it as young pliant oak; hammered it as forge-glowing iron;
      tempered it as steel; cast it as bronze; chiselled it as marble; painted
      it as a cloud; strung and tuned it as an instrument; lit it up as a life
      tower&mdash;the world&rsquo;s one beacon: steadily sending it onward through one
      trial form after another until at last had been perfected for it that
      angelic shape in which as man it was ever afterwards to sob and to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus as one day a wandering sea-shell had quit the sea and entered the
      forest, now on another day of that infinite time there reappeared at the
      edge of the forest the creature it had made. On every wall of its being
      internal and external forest-written; and completely forest-minded: having
      nothing but forest knowledge, forest feeling, forest dreams, forest
      fancies, forest faith; so that in all it could do or know or feel or dream
      or imagine or believe it was forest-tethered.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the edge of the forest then this creature uncontrollably impelled to
      emerge from the waving green sea of leaves as of old it had been driven to
      quit the rolling blue ocean of waters: Man at the dawn of our history of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if the first set of race memories&mdash;Sea Memories&mdash;still
      endure within him, how much more powerful are the second set&mdash;the
      Forest Memories!
    </p>
    <p>
      So powerful that since the dawn of history millions have perished as
      forest creatures only; so powerful that there are still remnant races on
      the globe which have never yet snapped the primitive tether and will
      become extinct as mere forest creatures to the last; so powerful that
      those highest races which have been longest out in the open&mdash;as our
      own Aryan race&mdash;have never ceased to be reached by the influence of
      the woods behind them; by the shadows of those tall morning trees falling
      across the mortal clearings toward the sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Master Memories, he said, filtering through the sandlike generations
      of our race, survive to-day as those pale attenuated affections which we
      call in ourselves the Love of Nature; these affections are inherited: new
      feelings for nature we have none. The writers of our day who speak of
      civilized man&rsquo;s love of nature as a developing sense err wholly. They are
      like explorers who should mistake a boundary for the interior of a
      continent. Man&rsquo;s knowledge of nature is modern, but it no more endows him
      with new feeling than modern knowledge of anatomy supplies him with a new
      bone or his latest knowledge about his blood furnishes him with an
      additional artery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old are our instincts and passions about Nature: all are Forest Memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      But among the many-twisted mass of them there is one, he said, that
      contains the separate buried root of the story: Man&rsquo;s Forest Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Spirit of the Forest had finished with the sea-shell, it had
      planted in him&mdash;there to grow forever&mdash;the root of faith that he
      was a forest child. His origin in the sea he had not yet discovered; the
      science of ages far distant in the future was to give him that. To himself
      forest-tethered he was also forest-born: he believed it to be his
      immediate ancestor, the creative father of mankind. Thus the Greeks in
      their oldest faith were tethered to the idea that they were descended from
      the plane tree; in the Sagas and Eddas the human race is tethered to the
      world-ash. Among every people of antiquity this forest faith sprang up and
      flourished: every race was tethered to some ancestral tree. In the Orient
      each succeeding Buddha of Indian mythology was tethered to a different
      tree; each god of the later classical Pantheon was similarly tethered:
      Jupiter to the oak, Apollo to the laurel, Bacchus to the vine, Minerva to
      the olive, Juno to the apple, on and on. Forest worship was universal&mdash;the
      most impressive and bewildering to modern science that the human spirit
      has ever built up. At the dawn of history began The Adoration of the
      Trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then as man, the wanderer, walked away from his dawn across the ages
      toward the sunset bearing within him this root of faith, it grew with his
      growth. The successive growths were cut down by the successive scythes of
      time; but always new sprouts were put forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus to man during the earliest ages the divine dwelt as a bodily presence
      within the forest; but one final day the forest lost the Immortal as its
      indwelling creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next the old forest worshipper peopled the trees with an intermediate race
      of sylvan deities less than divine, more than human; and long he beguiled
      himself with the exquisite reign and proximity of these; but the lesser
      could not maintain themselves in temples from which the greater had
      already been expelled, and they too passed out of sight down the roadway
      of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the old forest faith would not let the wanderer rest; and during yet
      later ages he sent into the trees his own nature so that the woods became
      freshly endeared to him by many a story of how individuals of his own race
      had succeeded as tenants to the erstwhile habitations of the gods. Then
      this last panorama of illusion faded also, and civilized man stood face to
      face with the modern woods&mdash;inhabitated only by its sap and cells.
      The trees had drawn their bark close around them, wearing an inviolate
      tapestry across those portals through which so many a stranger to them had
      passed in and passed out; and henceforth the dubious oracle of the forest&mdash;its
      one reply to all man&rsquo;s questionings&mdash;became the Voice of its own
      Mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the forest worshipper could worship the woods no more. But we
      must not forget that civilization as compared with the duration of human
      life on the planet began but yesterday: even our own Indo-European race
      dwells as it were on the forest edge. And the forest still reaches out and
      twines itself around our deepest spiritual truths: home&mdash;birth&mdash;love&mdash;prayer&mdash;death:
      it tries to overrun them all, to reclaim them. Thus when we build our
      houses, instinctively we attempt by some clump of trees to hide them and
      to shelter ourselves once more inside the forest; in some countries
      whenever a child is born, a tree is planted as its guardian in nature; in
      our marriage customs the forest still riots as master of ceremonies with
      garlands and fruits; our prayers strike against the forest shaped hi
      cathedral stone&mdash;memory of the grove, God&rsquo;s first temple; and when we
      die, it is the tree that is planted beside us as the sentinel of our rest.
      Even to this day the sight of a treeless grave arouses some obscure
      instinct in us that it is God-forsaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he said, whatsoever modern temple man has anywhere reared for his
      spirit, over the walls of it have been found growing the same leaf and
      tendril: he has introduced the tree into the ritual of every later
      world-worship; and thus he has introduced the evergreen into the ritual of
      Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This then is the meaning of the Christmas Tree and of its presence at the
      Nativity. At the dawn of history we behold man worshipping the tree as the
      Creator literally present on the earth; in our time we see him using that
      tree in the worship of the creative Father&rsquo;s Son come to earth in the
      Father&rsquo;s stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On this evergreen in the room falls the radiance of these brief tapers of
      the night; but on it rests also the long light of that spiritual dawn when
      man began his Adoration of the Trees. It is the forest taking its place
      once more beside the long-lost Immortal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he finished the first part of his story. That he should address her
      thus and that she thus should listen had in it nothing unusual for them.
      For years it had been his wont to traverse with her the ground of his
      lectures, and she shared his thought before it reached others. It was
      their high and equal comradeship. Wherever his mind could go hers went&mdash;a
      brilliant torch, a warming sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-night his words had fallen on her as withered leaves on a
      motionless figure of stone. If he was sensible of this change in her, he
      gave no sign. And after a moment he passed to the remaining part of the
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus far I have been speaking to you of the bare tree in wild nature:
      here it is loaded with decorations; and now I want to show you that they
      too are Forest Memories&mdash;that since the evergreen moved over into the
      service of Christianity, one by one like a flock of birds these Forest
      Memories have followed it and have alighted amid its branches. Everything
      here has its story. I am going to tell you in each case what that story
      is; I am going to interpret everything on the Christmas Tree and the other
      Christmas decorations in the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that her keen attention became fixed on him and never
      afterwards wavered. If everything had its story, the mistletoe would have
      its; he must interpret that: and thus he himself unexpectedly had brought
      about the situation she wished. She would meet him at that symbolic bough:
      there be rendered the Judgment of the Years! And now as one sits down at
      some point of a road where a traveller must arrive, she waited for him
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the Tree and explained briefly that as soon as the forest
      worshipper began the worship of the tree, he began to bring to it his
      offerings and to hang these on the boughs; for religion consists in
      offering something: to worship is to give. In after ages when man had
      learned to build shrines and temples, he still kept up his primitive
      custom of bringing to the altar his gifts and sacrifices; but during that
      immeasurable time before he had learned to carve wood or to set one stone
      on another, he was bringing his offerings to the grove&mdash;the only
      cathedral he had. And this to him was not decoration; it was prayer. So
      that in our age of the world when we playfully decorate the Christmas Tree
      it is a survival of grave rites in the worship of primitive man and is as
      ancient as forest worship itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the pointer in his hand he touched the star at the apex of the fir.
      This, he said, was commonly understood to represent the Star of Bethlehem
      which guided the wise men of the East to the manger on the Night of the
      Nativity&mdash;the Star of the New Born. But modern discoveries show that
      the records of ancient Chaldea go back four or five thousand years before
      the Christian era; and as far back as they have been traced, we find the
      wise men of the East worshipping this same star and being guided by it in
      their spiritual wanderings as they searched for the incarnation of the
      Divine. They worshipped it as the star of peace and goodness and purity.
      Many a pious Wolfram in those dim centuries no doubt sang his evening hymn
      to the same star, for love of some Chaldean Elizabeth&mdash;both he and
      she blown about the desert how many centuries now as dust. Moreover on
      these records the star and the Tree are brought together as here side by
      side. And the story of the star leads backward to one of the first things
      that man ever worshipped as he looked beyond the forest: the light of the
      heavens floating in the depth of space&mdash;light that he wanted but
      could not grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched the next object on the Tree&mdash;the candle under the star&mdash;and
      went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine, he said, the forest worshipper as at the end of ages having
      caught this light&mdash;having brought it down in the language of his myth
      from heaven to earth: that is, imagine the star in space as having become
      a star in his hand&mdash;the candle: the star worshipper had now become
      also the fire worshipper. Thus the candle leads us back to the fire
      worshippers of ancient Persia&mdash;those highlands of the spirit seeking
      light. We think of the Christmas candle on the Tree as merely borrowed
      from the candle of the altar for the purpose of illumination; but the use
      of it goes back to a time when the forest worshipper, now also the fire
      worshipper, hung his lights on the trees, having no other altar. Far down
      toward modern times the temples of the old Prussians, for example, were
      oak groves, and among them a hierarchy of priests was ordained to keep the
      sacred fire perpetually burning at the root of the sacred oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched the third object on the tree&mdash;the cross under the candle&mdash;and
      went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Christian believer the cross signifies one supreme event: Calvary
      and the tragedy of the Crucifixion. It was what the Marys saw and the
      apostles that morning in Gethsemane. But no one in that age thought of the
      cross as a Christian symbol. John and Peter and Paul and the rest went
      down into their graves without so regarding it. The Magdalene never clung
      to it with life-tired arms, nor poured out at the foot of it the benizon
      of her tears. Not until the third century after Christ did the Bishops
      assembled at Nice announce it a Christian symbol. But it was a sacred
      emblem in the dateless antiquity of Egypt. To primitive man it stood for
      that sacred light and fire of life which was himself. For he himself is a
      cross&mdash;the first cross he has ever known. The faithful may truly
      think of the Son of Man as crucified as the image of humanity. And thus
      ages before Christ, cross worship and forest worship were brought
      together: for instance, among the Druids who hunted for an oak, two boughs
      of which made with the trunk of the tree the figure of the cross; and on
      these three they cut the names of three of their gods and this was
      holy-cross wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved the pointer down until he touched the fourth object on the tree&mdash;the
      dove under the cross, and went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the mind of the Christian believer this represents the white dove of
      the New Testament which descended on the Son of Man when the heavens were
      opened. So in Parsifal the white dove descends, overshadowing the Grail.
      But ages before Christ the prolific white dove of Syria was worshipped
      throughout the Orient as the symbol of reproductive Nature: and to this
      day the Almighty is there believed to manifest himself under this form. In
      ancient Mesopotamia the divine mother of nature is often represented with
      this dove as having actually alighted on her shoulder or in her open hand.
      And here again forest worship early became associated with the worship of
      the dove; for, sixteen hundred years before Christ, we find the dove
      nurtured in the oak grove at Dodona where its presence was an augury and
      its wings an omen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On he went, touching one thing after another, tracing the story of each
      backward till it was lost in antiquity and showing how each was entwined
      with forest worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched the musical instruments; the bell, the drum. The bell, he said,
      was used in Greece by the Priests of Bacchus in the worship of the vine.
      And vine worship was forest worship. Moreover, in the same oak grove at
      Dodona bells were tied to the oak boughs and their tinklings also were
      sacred auguries. The drum, which the modern boy beats on Christmas Day,
      was beaten ages before Christ in the worship of Confucius: the story of it
      dies away toward what was man&rsquo;s first written music in forgotten China. In
      the first century of the Christian era, on one of the most splendid of the
      old Buddhist sculptures, boys are represented as beating the drum in the
      worship of the sacred tree&mdash;once more showing how music passed into
      the service of forest faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched the cornucopia; and he traced its story back to the ram&rsquo;s horn&mdash;the
      primitive cup of libation, used for a drinking cup and used also to pour
      out the last product of the vine in honor of the vine itself&mdash;the
      forest&rsquo;s first goblet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched the fruits and the flowers on the Tree: these were oldest of
      all, perhaps, he said; for before the forest worshipper had learned to
      shape or fabricate any offerings of his own skill, he could at least bring
      to the divine tree and hang on it the flower of spring, the wild fruit of
      autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept on until only three things on the Tree were left uninterpreted;
      the tinsel, the masks, and the dolls. He told her that he had left these
      to the last for a reason: seemingly they were the most trivial but really
      the most grave; for by means of them most clearly could be traced the
      presence of great law running through the progress of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her attention to the tinsel that covered the tree, draping it like
      a yellow moss. It was of no value, he said, but in the course of ages it
      had taken the place of the offering of actual gold in forest worship: a
      once universal custom of adorning the tree with everything most precious
      to the giver in token of his sacrifice and self-sacrifice. Even in
      Jeremiah is an account of the lading of the sacred tree with gold and
      ornaments. Herodotus relates that when Xerxes was invading Lydia, on the
      march he saw a divine tree and had it honored with golden robes and gifts.
      Livy narrates that when Romulus slew his enemy on the site of the Eternal
      City, he hung rich spoils on the oak of the Capitoline Hill. And this
      custom of decorating the tree with actual gold goes back in history until
      we can meet it coming down to us in the story of Jason and the Golden
      Fleece and in that of the Golden Apples of the Hesperides. Now the custom
      has dwindled to this tinsel flung over the Christmas Tree&mdash;the mock
      sacrifice for the real.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched the masks and unfolded the grim story that lay behind their
      mockery. It led back to the common custom in antiquity of sacrificing
      prisoners of war or condemned criminals or innocent victims in forest
      worship and of hanging their heads on the branches: we know this to have
      been the practice among Gallic and Teuton tribes. In the course of time,
      when such barbarity could be tolerated no longer, the mock countenance
      replaced the real.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched the dolls and revealed their sad story. Like the others, its
      long path led to antiquity and to the custom of sacrificing children in
      forest worship. How common this custom was the early literature of the
      human race too abundantly testifies. We encounter the trace of it in
      Abraham&rsquo;s sacrifice of Isaac&mdash;arrested by the command of Jehovah. But
      Abraham would never have thought of slaying his son to propitiate his God,
      had not the custom been well established. In the case of Jephthah&rsquo;s
      daughter the sacrifice was actually allowed. We come upon the same custom
      in the fate of Iphigenia&mdash;at a critical turning point in the world&rsquo;s
      mercy; in her stead the life of a lesser animal, as in Isaac&rsquo;s case, was
      accepted. When the protective charity of mankind turned against the
      inhumanity of the old faiths, then the substitution of the mock for the
      real sacrifice became complete. And now on the boughs of the Christmas
      Tree where richly we come upon vestiges of primitive rites only these
      playful toys are left to suggest the massacre of the innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had covered the ground; everything had yielded its story. All the
      little stories, like pathways running backward into the distance and ever
      converging, met somewhere in lost ages; they met in forest worship and
      they met in some sacrifice by the human heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus he drew his conclusion as the lesson of the night:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus, Josephine, my story ends for you and for me. The Christmas Tree is
      all that is left of a forest memory. The forest worshipper could not
      worship without giving, because to worship is to give: therefore he
      brought his gifts to the forest&mdash;his first altar. These gifts,
      remember, were never, as with us, decorations. They were his sacrifices
      and self-sacrifices. In all the religions he has had since, the same law
      lives. In his lower religions he has sacrificed the better to the worse;
      in the higher ones he has sacrificed the worst to the best. If the race
      should ever outgrow all religion whatsoever, it would still have to
      worship what is highest in human nature and so worshipping, it would still
      be ruled by the ancient law of sacrifice become the law of self-sacrifice:
      it would still be necessary to offer up what is low in us to what is
      higher. Only one portion of mankind has ever believed in Jerusalem; but
      every religion has known its own Calvary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away from the Tree toward her and awaited her appreciation. She
      had sat watching him without a movement and without a word. But when at
      last she asked him a question, she spoke as a listener who wakens from a
      long revery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you finished the story for me?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have finished the story for you,&rdquo; he replied without betraying
      disappointment at her icy reception of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping her posture, she raised one of her white arms above her head,
      turning her face up also until the swanlike curve of the white throat
      showed; and with quivering finger tips she touched some sprays of
      mistletoe pendent from the garland on the wall:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not interpreted this,&rdquo; she said, her mind fixed on that sole
      omission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not explained that,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat up, and for the first time looked with intense interest toward the
      manuscript on the table across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you explained it there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not explained it there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; she said with disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not wish you to read that story, Josephine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, Frederick?&rdquo; she inquired, startled into wonderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled: &ldquo;If I told you why, I might as well tell you the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you not wish to tell me the story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered with warning frankness: &ldquo;If you once saw it as a picture, the
      picture would be coming back to you at times the rest of your life
      darkly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She protested: &ldquo;If it is dark to you, why should I not share the darkness
      of it? Have we not always looked at life&rsquo;s shadows together? And thus
      seeing life, have not bright things been doubly bright to us and dark
      things but half as dark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He merely repeated his warning: &ldquo;It is a story of a crueler age than ours.
      It goes back to the forest worship of the Druids.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered: &ldquo;So long as our own age is cruel, what room is left to take
      seriously the mere stories of crueler ones? Am I to shrink from the forest
      worship of the Druids? Is there any story of theirs not printed in books?
      Are not the books in libraries? Are they not put in libraries to be read?
      If others read them, may not I? And since when must I begin to dread
      anything in books? Or anything in life? And since when did we begin to
      look at life apart, we who have always looked at it with four eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always told you there are things to see with four eyes, things to
      see with two, and things to see with none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With sudden intensity her white arm went up again and touched the
      mistletoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me the story of this!&rdquo; she pleaded as though she demanded a right.
      As she spoke, her thumb and forefinger meeting on a spray, they closed and
      went through it like a pair of shears; and a bunch of the white pearls of
      the forest dropped on the ridge of her shoulder and were broken apart and
      rolled across her breast into her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked grave; silence or speech&mdash;which were better for her?
      Either, he now saw, would give her pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happily the story is far away from us,&rdquo; he said, as though he were half
      inclined to grant her request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is far away, bring it near! Bring it into the room as you brought
      the stories of the star and the candle and the cross and the dove and the
      others! Make it live before my eyes! Enact it before me! Steep me in it as
      you have steeped yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held back a long time: &ldquo;You who are so safe in good, why know evil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederick,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I shall have to insist upon your telling me this
      story. And if you should keep any part of it back, I would know. Then tell
      it all: if it is dark, let each shadow have its shade; give each heavy
      part its heaviness; let cruelty be cruelty&mdash;and truth be truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood gazing across the centuries, and when he began, there was a
      change in him; something personal was beginning to intrude itself into the
      narrative of the historian:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagine the world of our human nature in the last centuries before
      Palestine became Holy Land. Athens stood with her marbles glistening by
      the blue Ægean, and Greek girls with fillets and sandals&mdash;the living
      images of those pale sculptured shapes that are the mournful eternity of
      Art&mdash;Greek girls were being chosen for the secret rites in the temple
      at Ephesus. The sun of Italy had not yet browned the little children who
      were to become the brown fathers and mothers of the brown soldiers of
      Cæsar&rsquo;s legions; and twenty miles south of Rome, in the sacred grove of
      Dodona,&mdash;where the motions of oak boughs were auguries, and the
      flappings of the wings of white doves were divine messages, and the
      tinkling of bells in the foliage had divine meanings,&mdash;in this grove
      the virgins of Latium, as the Greek girls of Ephesus, were once a year
      appointed to undergo similar rites. To the south Pompeii, with its night
      laughter and song sounding far out toward the softly lapping Mediterranean
      and up the slopes of its dread volcano, drained its goblet and did not
      care, emptied it as often as filled and asked for nothing more. A little
      distance off Herculaneum, with its tender dreams of Greece but with its
      arms around the breathing image of Italy, slept&mdash;uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond Italy to the north, on the other side of the eternal snowcaps, lay
      unknown Gaul, not yet dreaming of the Cæsar who was to conquer it; and
      across the wild sea opposite Gaul lay the wooded isle of Britain. All over
      that island one forest; in that forest one worship; in that worship one
      tree&mdash;the oak of England; and on that oak one bough&mdash;the
      mistletoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to her awhile about the oak, describing the place it had in the
      early civilizations of the human race. In the Old Testament it was the
      tree of the Hebrew idols and of Jehovah. In Greece it was the tree of
      Zeus, the most august and the most human of the gods. In Italy it was the
      tree of Jove, great father of immortals and of mankind. After the gods
      passed, it became the tree of the imperial Cæsars. After the Cæsars had
      passed, it was the oak that Michael Angelo in the Middle Ages scattered
      over the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel near the creation of man and his
      expulsion from Paradise&mdash;there as always the chosen tree of human
      desire. In Britain it was the sacred tree of Druidism: there the Arch
      Druid and his fellow-priests performed none of their rites without using
      its leaves and branches: never anywhere in the world was the oak
      worshipped with such ceremonies and sacrifices as there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine then a scene&mdash;the chief Nature Festival of that forest
      worship: the New Year&rsquo;s day of the Druids.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vast concourse of people, men and women and children, are on their way
      to the forest; they are moving toward an oak tree that has been found with
      mistletoe growing on it&mdash;growing there so seldom. As the excited
      throng come in sight of it, they hail it with loud cries of reverence and
      delight. Under it they gather; there a banquet is spread. In the midst of
      the assemblage one figure towers&mdash;the Arch Druid. Every eye is fixed
      fearfully on him, for on whomsoever his own eye may fall with wrath, he
      may be doomed to become one of the victims annually sacrificed to the oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gold chain is around his neck; gold bands are around his arms. He is
      clad in robes of spotless white. He ascends the tree to a low bough, and
      making a hollow in the folds of his robes, he crops with a golden pruning
      hook the mistletoe and so catches it as it falls. Then it is blessed and
      scattered among the throng, and the priest prays that each one so
      receiving it may receive also the divine favor and blessing of which it is
      Nature&rsquo;s emblem. Two white bulls, the horns of which have never hitherto
      been touched, are now adorned with fillets and are slaughtered in
      sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at last it is over, the people are gone, the forest is left to
      itself, and the New Year&rsquo;s ceremony of cutting the mistletoe from the oak
      is at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he ended the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had sat leaning far forward, her fingers interlocked and her brows
      knitted. When he stopped, she sat up and studied him a moment in
      bewilderment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you call that a dark story?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Where is the
      cruelty? It is beautiful, and I shall never forget it and it will never
      throw a dark image on my mind: New Year&rsquo;s day&mdash;the winter woods&mdash;the
      journeying throng&mdash;the oak&mdash;the bough&mdash;the banquet beneath&mdash;the
      white bulls with fillets on their horns&mdash;the white-robed priest&mdash;the
      golden sickle in his hand&mdash;the stroke that severs the mistletoe&mdash;the
      prayer that each soul receiving any smallest piece will be blessed in
      life&rsquo;s sorrows! If I were a great painter, I should like to paint that
      scene. In the centre should be some young girl, pressing to her heart what
      she believed to be heaven&rsquo;s covenant with her under the guise of a
      blossom. How could you have wished to withhold such a story from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her a little sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not yet told you all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have told you enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly she bent far over toward him with intuitive scrutiny. Under her
      breath one word escaped:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the breath of a discovery&mdash;a discovery of something unknown to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sparing you, Josephine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stretched each arm along the back of the sofa and pinioned the wood in
      her clutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sparing me?&rdquo; she asked in a tone of torture. &ldquo;Or are you sparing
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy staff on which he stood leaning dropped from his relaxed grasp
      to the floor. He looked down at it a moment and then calmly picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to tell you the story,&rdquo; he said with a new quietness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aroused by some change in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not listen! I do not wish to hear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to listen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is better for you to know. Better
      for any human being to know any truth than suffer the bane of wrong
      thinking. When you are free to judge, it will be impossible for you to
      misjudge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not misjudged you! I have not judged you! In some way that I do
      not understand you are judging yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped back a pace&mdash;farther away from her&mdash;and he drew
      himself up. In the movement there was instinctive resentment. And the
      right not to be pried into&mdash;not even by the nearest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The step which had removed him farther from her had brought him nearer to
      the Christmas Tree at his back. A long, three-fingered bough being thus
      pressed against was forced upward and reappeared on one of his shoulders.
      The movement seemed human: it was like the conscious hand of the tree. The
      fir, standing there decked out in the artificial tawdriness of a
      double-dealing race, laid its wild sincere touch on him&mdash;as sincere
      as the touch of dying human fingers&mdash;and let its passing youth flow
      into him. It attracted his attention, and he turned his head toward it as
      with recognition. Other boughs near the floor likewise thrust themselves
      forward, hiding his feet so that he stood ankle-deep in forestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reunion did not escape her. Her overwrought imagination made of it a
      sinister omen: the bough on his shoulder rested there as the old forest
      claim; the boughs about his feet were the ancestral forest tether. As he
      had stepped backward from her, Nature had asserted the earlier right to
      him. In strange sickness and desolation of heart she waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood facing her but looking past her at centuries long gone; the first
      sound of his voice registered upon her ear some message of doom:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Josephine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She buried her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot! I will not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to listen. You know that for some years, apart from my
      other work, I have been gathering together the woodland customs of our
      people and trying to trace them back to their origin and first meaning. In
      our age of the world we come upon many playful forest survivals of what
      were once grave things. Often in our play and pastimes and lingering
      superstitions about the forest we cross faint traces of what were once
      vital realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among these there has always been one that until recently I have never
      understood. Among country people oftenest, but heard of everywhere, is the
      saying that if a girl is caught standing under the mistletoe, she may be
      kissed by the man who thus finds her. I have always thought that this
      ceremony and playful sacrifice led back to some ancient rite&mdash;I could
      not discover what. Now I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a voice full of a new delicacy and scarcely audible, he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is another scene in the forest of Britain. This time it is not the
      first day of the year&mdash;the New Year&rsquo;s day of the Druids when they
      celebrated the national festival of the oak. But it is early summer,
      perhaps the middle of May&mdash;May in England&mdash;with the young beauty
      of the woods. It is some hushed evening at twilight. The new moon is just
      silvering the tender leaves and creating a faint shadow under the trees.
      The hawthorn is in bloom&mdash;red and white&mdash;and not far from the
      spot, hidden in some fragrant tuft of this, a nightingale is singing,
      singing, singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lifting itself above the smaller growths stands the young manhood of the
      woods&mdash;a splendid oak past its thirtieth year, representing its youth
      and its prime conjoined. In its trunk is the summer heat of the all-day
      sun. Around its roots is velvet turf, and there are wild violet beds. Its
      huge arms are stretched toward the ground as though reaching for some
      object they would clasp; and on one of these arms as its badge of divine
      authority, worn there as a knight might wear the colors of his Sovereign,
      grows the mistletoe. There he stands&mdash;the Forest Lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woods wait, the shadows deepen, the hush is more intense, the moon&rsquo;s
      rays begin to be golden, the song of the nightingale grows more
      passionate, the beds of moss and violets wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the shrubbery is tremblingly parted at some place and upon the scene
      a young girl enters&mdash;her hair hanging down&mdash;her limbs most
      lightly clad&mdash;the flush of red hawthorn on the white hawthorn of her
      skin&mdash;in her eyes love&rsquo;s great need and mystery. Step by step she
      comes forward, her fingers trailing against whatsoever budding wayside
      thing may stay her strength. She draws nearer to the oak, searching amid
      its boughs for that emblem which she so dreads to find and yet more dreads
      not to find: the emblem of a woman&rsquo;s fruitfulness which the young oak&mdash;the
      Forest Lover&mdash;reaches down toward her. Finding it, beneath it with
      one deep breath of surrender she takes her place&mdash;the virgin&rsquo;s tryst
      with the tree&mdash;there to be tested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the command of the Arch Druid: it is obedience&mdash;submission to
      that test&mdash;or death for her as a sacrifice to the oak which she has
      rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the shrubbery is parted, rudely pushed aside, and a man enters&mdash;a
      tried and seasoned man&mdash;a human oak&mdash;counterpart of the Forest
      Lover&mdash;to officiate at the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

      <br /><br />

    <p>
      He was standing there in the parlor of his house and in the presence of
      his wife. But in fealty he was gone: he was in the summer woods of
      ancestral wandering, the fatherland of Old Desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>He</i> was the man treading down the shrubbery; it was <i>his</i> feet
      that started toward the oak; <i>his</i> eye that searched for the figure
      half fainting under the bough; for <i>him</i> the bed of moss and violets&mdash;the
      hair falling over the eyes&mdash;the loosened girdle&mdash;the breasts of
      hawthorn white and pink&mdash;the listening song of the nightingale&mdash;the
      silence of the summer woods&mdash;the seclusion&mdash;the full surrender
      of the two under that bough of the divine command, to escape the penalty
      of their own death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blaze of uncontrollable desire was all over him; the fire of his own
      story had treacherously licked him like a wind-bent flame. The light that
      she had not seen in his eyes for so long rose in them&mdash;the old,
      unfathomable, infolding tenderness. A quiver ran around his tense
      nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now one little phrase which he had uttered so sacredly years before
      and had long since forgotten rose a second time to his lips&mdash;tossed
      there by a second tide of feeling. On the silence of the room fell his
      words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Bride of the Mistletoe!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The storm that had broken over him died away. He shut his eyes on the
      vanishing scene: he opened them upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had told her the truth about the story; he may have been aware or he
      may not have been aware that he had revealed to her the truth about
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I would have kept from you, Josephine,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting there before him&mdash;the mother of his children, of the
      sleeping ones, of the buried ones&mdash;the butterfly broken on the wheel
      of years: lustreless and useless now in its summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat there with the whiteness of death.

      V. THE ROOM OF THE SILENCES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Christmas candles looked at her flickeringly; the little white candles
      of purity, the little red candles of love. The holly in the room concealed
      its bold gay berries behind its thorns, and the cedar from the faithful
      tree beside the house wall had need now of its bitter rosary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first act was to pay what is the first debt of a fine spirit&mdash;the
      debt of courtesy and gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a wonderful story, Frederick,&rdquo; she said in a manner which showed
      him that she referred to the beginning of his story and not to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As usual you have gone your own way about it, opening your own path into
      the unknown, seeing what no one else has seen, and bringing back what no
      one else ever brought. It is a great revelation of things that I never
      dreamed of and could never have imagined. I appreciate your having done
      this for me; it has taken time and work, but it is too much for me
      to-night. It is too new and too vast. I must hereafter try to understand
      it. And there will be leisure enough. Nor can it lose by waiting. But now
      there is something that cannot wait, and I wish to speak to you about
      that; Frederick, I am going to ask you some questions about the last part
      of the story. I have been wanting to ask you a long time: the story gives
      me the chance and&mdash;the right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He advanced a step toward her, disengaging himself from the evergreen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will answer them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If they can be answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus she sat and thus he stood as the questions and answers passed to
      and fro. They were solemn questions and solemn replies, drawn out of the
      deeps of life and sinking back into them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frederick,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for many years we have been happy together, so
      happy! Every tragedy of nature has stood at a distance from us except the
      loss of our children. We have lived on a sunny pinnacle of our years,
      lifted above life&rsquo;s storms. But of course I have realized that sooner or
      later our lot must become the common one: if we did not go down to Sorrow,
      Sorrow would climb to us; and I knew that on the heights it dwells best.
      That is why I wish to say to you to-night what I shall: I think fate&rsquo;s
      hour has struck for me; I am ready to hear it. Its arrow has already left
      the bow and is on its way; I open my heart to receive it. This is as I
      have always wished; I have said that if life had any greatest tragedy, for
      me, I hoped it would come when I was happiest; thus I should confront it
      all. I have never drunk half of my cup of happiness, as you know, and let
      the other half waste; I must go equally to the depth of any suffering.
      Worse than the suffering, I think, would be the feeling that I had shirked
      some of it, had stepped aside, or shut my eyes, or in any manner shown
      myself a cowardly soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a pause she went over this subject as though she were not satisfied
      that she had made it clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always said that the real pathos of things is the grief that comes
      to us in life when life is at its best&mdash;when no one is to blame&mdash;when
      no one has committed a fault&mdash;when suffering is meted out to us as
      the reward of our perfect obedience to the laws of nature. In earlier
      years when we used to read Keats together, who most of all of the world&rsquo;s
      poets felt the things that pass, even then I was wondering at the way in
      which he brings this out: that to understand Sorrow it must be separated
      from sorrows: they would be like shadows darkening the bright disk of
      life&rsquo;s clear tragedy, thus rendering it less bravely seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so he is always telling us not to summon sad pictures nor play with
      mournful emblems; not to feign ourselves as standing on the banks of
      Lethe, gloomiest of rivers; nor to gather wolf&rsquo;s bane and twist the poison
      out of its tight roots; nor set before us the cup of hemlock; nor bind
      about our temples the ruby grape of nightshade; nor count over the berries
      of the yew tree which guards sad places; nor think of the beetle ticking
      in the bed post, nor watch the wings of the death moth, nor listen to the
      elegy of the owl&mdash;the voice of ruins. Not these! they are the emblems
      of our sorrows. But the emblems of Sorrow are beautiful things at their
      perfect moment; a red peony just opening, a rainbow seen for an instant on
      the white foam, youth not yet faded but already fading, joy with its
      finger on his lips, bidding adieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so with all my happiness about me, I wish to know life&rsquo;s tragedy. And
      to know it, Frederick, not to infer it: <i>I want to be told</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can be told, you shall be told,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She changed her position as though seeking physical relief and composure.
      Then she began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Years ago when you were a student in Germany, you had a college friend.
      You went home with him two or three years at Christmas and celebrated the
      German Christmas. It was in this way that we came to have the Christmas
      Tree in our house&mdash;through memory of him and of those years. You have
      often described to me how you and he in summer went Alpine climbing, and
      far up in some green valley girdled with glaciers lay of afternoons under
      some fir tree, reading and drowsing in the crystalline air. You told me of
      your nights of wandering down the Rhine together when the heart turns so
      intimately to the heart beside it. He was German youth and song and dream
      and happiness to you. Tell me this: before you lost him that last summer
      over the crevasse, had you begun to tire of him? Was there anything in you
      that began to draw back from anything in him? As you now look back at the
      friendship of your youth, have the years lessened your regret for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered out of the ideals of his youth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The longer I knew him, the more I loved him. I never tired of being with
      him. Nothing in me ever drew back from anything in him. When he was lost,
      the whole world lost some of its strength and nobility. After all the
      years, if he could come back, he would find me unchanged&mdash;that friend
      of my youth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a peculiar change of voice she asked next:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor, Herbert and Elsie&rsquo;s father, our nearest neighbor, your
      closest friend now in middle life. You see a great deal of the doctor; he
      is often here, and you and he often sit up late at night, talking with one
      another about many things: do you ever tire of the doctor and wish him
      away? Have you any feeling toward him that you try to keep secret from me?
      Can you be a perfectly frank man with this friend of your middle life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The longer I know him the more I like him, honor him, trust him. I never
      tire of his companionship or his conversation; I have no disguises with
      him and need none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The children! As the children grow older do you care less for them? Do
      they begin to wear on you? Are they a clog, an interference? Have Harold
      and Elizabeth ceased forming new growths of affection in you? Do you ever
      unconsciously seek pretexts for avoiding them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The older they grow, the more I love them. The more they interest me and
      tempt away from work and duties. I am more drawn to be with them and I
      live more and more in the thought of what they are becoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your work! Does your work attract you less than formerly? Does it develop
      in you the purpose to be something more or stifle in you the regret to be
      something less? Is it a snare to idleness or a goad to toil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the mariner steers for the lighthouse, as the hound runs down the
      stag, as the soldier wakes to the bugle, as the miner digs for fortune, as
      the drunkard drains the cup, as the saint watches the cross, I follow my
      work, I follow my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life, life itself, does it increase in value or lessen? Is the world
      still morning to you with your work ahead or afternoon when you begin to
      tire and to think of rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world to me is as early morning to a man going forth to his work.
      Where the human race is from and whither it is hurrying and why it exists
      at all; why a human being loves what it loves and hates what it hates; why
      it is faithful when it could be unfaithful and faithless when it should be
      true; how civilized man can fight single handed against the ages that were
      his lower past&mdash;how he can develop self-renunciation out of
      selfishness and his own wisdom out of surrounding folly,&mdash;all these
      are questions that mean more and more. My work is but beginning and the
      world is morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This house! Are you tired of it now that it is older? Would you rather
      move into a new one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love this house more and more. No other dwelling could take its place.
      Any other could be but a shelter; this is home. And I care more for it now
      that the signs of age begin to settle on it. If it were a ruin, I should
      love it best!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned over and looked down at the two setters lying at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you care less for the dogs of the house as they grow older?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think more of them and take better care of them now that their hunting
      days are over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The friend of your youth&mdash;the friend of your middle age&mdash;the
      children&mdash;your profession&mdash;the world of human life&mdash;this
      house&mdash;the dogs of the house&mdash;you care more for them all as time
      passes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care more for them all as time passes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there came a great stillness in the room&mdash;the stillness of all
      listening years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I the only thing that you care less for as time passes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I in the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to go over it all again with another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hidden her face in her hands and pressed her head against the end
      of the sofa. Her whole figure shrank lower, as though to escape being
      touched by him&mdash;to escape the blow of his words. No words came. There
      was no touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later she felt that he must be standing over her, looking down at
      her. She would respond to his hand on the back of her neck. He must be
      kneeling beside her; his arms would infold her. Then with a kind of
      incredible terror she realized that he was not there. At first she could
      so little believe it, that with her face still buried in one hand she
      searched the air for him with the other, expecting to touch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she cried out to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there anything you can say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence lasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Oh, Fred! Fred! Fred! Fred</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the stillness she began to hear something&mdash;the sound of his
      footsteps moving on the carpet. She sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was getting darker; he was putting out the candles. It was too
      dark already to see his face. With fascination she began to watch his
      hand. How steady it was as it moved among the boughs, extinguishing the
      lights. Out they went one by one and back into their darkness returned the
      emblems of darker ages&mdash;the Forest Memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      A solitary taper was left burning at the pinnacle of the Tree under the
      cross: that highest torch of love shining on everything that had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He quietly put it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the light seemed not put out, but instantly to have travelled through
      the open parlor door into the adjoining room, her bedroom; for out of that
      there now streamed a suffused red light; it came from the lamp near the
      great bed in the shadowy corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lamp poured its light through a lampshade having the semblance of a
      bursting crimson peony as some morning in June the flower with the weight
      of its own splendor falls face downward on the grass. And in that room
      this soft lamp-light fell here and there on crimson winter draperies. He
      had been living alone as a bachelor before he married her. After they
      became engaged he, having watched for some favorite color of hers, had had
      this room redecorated in that shade. Every winter since she had renewed in
      this way or that way these hangings, and now the bridal draperies remained
      unchanged&mdash;after the changing years.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replaced the taper against the wall and came over and stood before her,
      holding out his hands to help her rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arose without his aid and passed around him, moving toward her
      bedroom. With arms outstretched guarding her but not touching her, he
      followed close, for she was unsteady. She entered her bedroom and crossed
      to the door of his bedroom; she pushed this open, and keeping her face
      bent aside waited for him to go in. He went in and she closed the door on
      him and turned the key. Then with a low note, with which the soul tears
      out of itself something that has been its life, she made a circlet of her
      white arms against the door and laid her profile within this circlet and
      stood&mdash;the figure of Memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus sometimes a stranger sees a marble figure standing outside a tomb
      where some story of love and youth ended: some stranger in a far land,&mdash;walking
      some afternoon in those quieter grounds where all human stories end; an
      autumn bird in the bare branches fluting of its mortality and his heart
      singing with the bird of one lost to him&mdash;lost to him in his own
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the door the silence was that of a tomb. She had felt
      confident&mdash;so far as she had expected anything&mdash;that he would
      speak to her through the door, try to open it, plead with her to open it.
      Nothing of the kind occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did he not come back? What bolt could have separated her from him?
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence began to weigh upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in the tense stillness she heard him moving quietly about, getting
      ready for bed. There were the same movements, familiar to her for years.
      She would not open the door, she could not leave it, she could not stand,
      no support was near, and she sank to the floor and sat there, leaning her
      brow against the lintel.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side the quiet preparations went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard him take off his coat and vest and hang them on the back of a
      chair. The buttons made a little scraping sound against the wood. Then he
      went to his dresser and took off his collar and tie, and he opened a
      drawer and laid out a night-shirt. She heard the creaking of a chair under
      him as he threw one foot and then the other up across his knee and took
      off his shoes and socks. Then there reached her the soft movements of his
      bare feet on the carpet (despite her agony the old impulse started in her
      to caution him about his slippers). Then followed the brushing of his
      teeth and the deliberate bathing of his hands. Then was audible the puff
      of breath with which he blew out his lamp after he had turned it low; and
      then,&mdash;on the other side of the door,&mdash;just above her ear his
      knock sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same knock waited for and responded to throughout the years; so often
      with his little variations of playfulness. Many a time in early summer
      when out-of-doors she would be reminded of it by hearing some bird
      sounding its love signal on a piece of dry wood&mdash;that tap of
      heart-beat. Now it crashed close to her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such strength came back to her that she rose as lightly as though her
      flesh were but will and spirit. When he knocked again, she was across the
      room, sitting on the edge of her bed with her palms pressed together and
      thrust between her knees: the instinctive act of a human animal suddenly
      chilled to the bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knocking sounded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there anything you needed?&rdquo; she asked fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no response but another knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurriedly raised her voice to make sure that it would reach him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there anything you wanted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As no response came, the protective maternal instinct took greater alarm,
      and she crossed to the door of his room and she repeated her one question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you forget anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mind refused to release itself from the iteration of that idea: it was
      some <i>thing</i>&mdash;not herself&mdash;that he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her imagination, long oppressed by his silence, now made of his knock some
      signal of distress. It took on the authority of an appeal not to be
      denied. She unlocked the door and opened it a little way, and once more
      she asked her one poor question.
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer to it came in the form of a gentle pressure against the door,
      breaking down her resistance. As she applied more strength, this was as
      gently overcome; and when the opening was sufficient, he walked past her
      into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      How hushed the house! How still the world outside as the cloud wove in
      darkness its mantle of light!

    <h2>
      VI. THE WHITE DAWN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Day was breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crimson curtains of the bedroom were drawn close, but from behind
      their outer edges faint flanges of light began to advance along the wall.
      It was a clear light reflected from snow which had sifted in against the
      window-panes, was banked on the sills outside, ridged the yard fence,
      peaked the little gate-posts, and buried the shrubbery. There was no need
      to look out in order to know that it had stopped snowing, that the air was
      windless, and that the stars were flashing silver-pale except one&mdash;great
      golden-croziered shepherd of the thick, soft-footed, moving host.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Christmas morning on the effulgent Shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already there was sufficient light in the room to reveal&mdash;less as
      actual things than as brown shadows of the memory&mdash;a gay company of
      socks and stockings hanging from the mantelpiece; sufficient to give
      outline to the bulk of a man asleep on the edge of the bed; and it exposed
      to view in a corner of the room farthest from the rays a woman sitting in
      a straight-backed chair, a shawl thrown about her shoulders over her
      night-dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He always slept till he was awakened; the children, having stayed up past
      their usual bedtime, would sleep late also; she had the white dawn to
      herself in quietness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She needed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep could not have come to her had she wished. She had not slept and she
      had not lain down, and the sole endeavor during those shattered hours had
      been to prepare herself for his awakening. She was not yet ready&mdash;she
      felt that during the rest of her life she should never be quite ready to
      meet him again. Scant time remained now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon all over the Shield indoor merriment and outdoor noises would begin.
      Wherever in the lowlands any many-chimneyed city, proud of its size, rose
      by the sweep of watercourses, or any little inland town was proud of its
      smallness and of streets that terminated in the fields; whereever any
      hamlet marked the point at which two country roads this morning made the
      sign of the white cross, or homesteads stood proudly castled on woody
      hilltops, or warmed the heart of the beholder from amid their olive-dark
      winter pastures; or far away on the shaggy uplift of the Shield wherever
      any cabin clung like a swallow&rsquo;s nest against the gray Appalachian wall&mdash;everywhere
      soon would begin the healthy outbreak of joy among men and women and
      children&mdash;glad about themselves, glad in one another, glad of human
      life in a happy world. The many-voiced roar and din of this warm carnival
      lay not far away from her across the cold bar of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon within the house likewise the rush of the children&rsquo;s feet would
      startle her ear; they would be tugging at the door, tugging at her heart.
      And as she thought of this, the recollection of old simple things came
      pealing back to her from behind life&rsquo;s hills. The years parted like naked
      frozen reeds, and she, sorely stricken in her womanhood, fled backward
      till she herself was a child again&mdash;safe in her father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s
      protection. It was Christmas morning, and she in bare feet was tipping
      over the cold floors toward their bedroom&mdash;toward her stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father and mother! How she needed them at this moment: they had been
      sweethearts all their lives. One picture of them rose with distinctness
      before her&mdash;for the wounding picture always comes to the wounded
      moment. She saw them sitting in their pew far down toward the chancel.
      Through a stained glass window (where there was a ladder of angels) the
      light fell softly on them&mdash;both silver-haired; and as with the voices
      of children they were singing out of one book. She remembered how as she
      sat between them she had observed her father slip his hand into her
      mother&rsquo;s lap and clasp hers with a steadfastness that wedded her for
      eternity; and thus over their linked hands, with the love of their youth
      within them and the snows of the years upon them, they sang together:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Gently, Lord, O gently lead us
     *     *     *     *     *     *
  &ldquo;Through the changes Thou&rsquo;st decreed us.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Her father and mother had not been led gently. They had known more than
      common share of life&rsquo;s shocks and violence, its wrongs and meannesses and
      ills and griefs. But their faith had never wavered that they were being
      led gently; so long as they were led together, to them it was gentle
      leading: the richer each in each for aught whereby nature or man could
      leave them poorer; the calmer for the shocks; the sweeter for the sour;
      the finer with one another because of life&rsquo;s rudenesses. In after years
      she often thought of them as faithful in their dust; and the flowers she
      planted over them and watered many a bright day with happy tears brought
      up to her in another form the freshness of their unwearied union.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what she had not doubted her own life would be&mdash;with him&mdash;when
      she had married him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment of the night before when he had forced the door open and
      entered her room, they had not exchanged any words nor a glance. He had
      lain down and soon fallen asleep; apparently he had offered that to her as
      for the moment at least his solution of the matter&mdash;that he should
      leave her to herself and absent himself in slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant she knew him to be asleep she set about her preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he awoke she must be gone&mdash;out of the house&mdash;anywhere&mdash;to
      save herself from living any longer with him. His indifference in the
      presence of her suffering; his pitiless withdrawal from her of touch and
      glance and speech as she had gone down into that darkest of life&rsquo;s
      valleys; his will of iron that since she had insisted upon knowing the
      whole truth, know it she should: all this left her wounded and stunned as
      by an incredible blow, and she was acting first from the instinct of
      removing herself beyond the reach of further humiliation and brutality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively she took off her wedding ring and laid it on his dresser
      beside his watch: he would find it there in the morning and he could
      dispose of it. Then she changed her dress for the plainest heavy one and
      put on heavy walking shoes. She packed into a handbag a few necessary
      things with some heirlooms of her own. Among the latter was a case of
      family jewels; and as she opened it, her eyes fell upon her mother&rsquo;s thin
      wedding ring and with quick reverence she slipped that on and kissed it
      bitterly. She lifted out also her mother&rsquo;s locket containing a miniature
      daguerreotype of her father and dutifully fed her eyes on that. Her father
      was not silver-haired then, but raven-locked; with eyes that men feared at
      times but no woman ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were on her now as so often in girlhood when he had curbed her
      exuberance and guided her waywardness. He was watching as she, coarsely
      wrapped and carrying some bundle of things of her own, opened her front
      door, left her footprints in the snow on the porch, and passed out&mdash;wading
      away. Those eyes of his saw what took place the next day: the happiness of
      Christmas morning turned into horror; the children wild with distress and
      crying&mdash;the servants dumb&mdash;the inquiry at neighbors&rsquo; houses&mdash;the
      news spreading to the town&mdash;the papers&mdash;the black ruin. And from
      him two restraining words issued for her ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Passionately she bore the picture to her lips and her pride answered him.
      And so answering, it applied a torch to her blood and her blood took fire
      and a flame of rage spread through and swept her. She stopped her
      preparations: she had begun to think as well as to feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She unpacked her travelling bag, putting each article back into its place
      with exaggerated pains. Having done this, she stood in the middle of the
      floor, looking about her irresolute: then responding to that power of low
      suggestion which is one of anger&rsquo;s weapons, she began to devise malice.
      She went to a wardrobe and stooping down took from a bottom drawer&mdash;where
      long ago it had been stored away under everything else&mdash;a shawl that
      had been her grandmother&rsquo;s; a brindled crewel shawl,&mdash;sometimes worn
      by superannuated women of a former generation; a garment of hideousness.
      Once, when a little girl, she had loyally jerked it off her grandmother
      because it added to her ugliness and decrepitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook this out with mocking eyes and threw it decoratively around her
      shoulders. She strode to the gorgeous peony lampshade and lifting it off,
      gibbeted it and scattered the fragments on the floor. She turned the lamp
      up as high as it would safely burn so that the huge lidless eye of it
      would throw its full glare on him and her. She drew a rocking chair to the
      foot of the bed and seating herself put her forefinger up to each temple
      and drew out from their hiding places under the mass of her black hair two
      long gray locks and let these hang down haglike across her bosom. She
      banished the carefully nourished look of youth from her face&mdash;dropped
      the will to look young&mdash;and allowed the forced-back years to rush
      into it&mdash;into the wastage, the wreckage, which he and Nature,
      assisting each other so ably, had wrought in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat there half-crazed, rocking noisily; waiting for the glare of the
      lamp to cause him to open his eyes; and she smiled upon him in exultation
      of vengeance that she was to live on there in his house&mdash;<i>his</i>
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while a darker mood came over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With noiseless steps lest she awake him, she began to move about the room.
      She put out the lamp and lighted her candle and set it where it would be
      screened from his face; and where the shadow of the chamber was heaviest,
      into that shadow she retired and in it she sat&mdash;with furtive look to
      see whether he observed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pall-like stillness deepened about the bed where he lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running in her veins a wellnigh pure stream across the generations was
      Anglo-Saxon blood of the world&rsquo;s fiercest; floating in the tide of it
      passions of old family life which had dyed history for all time in
      tragedies of false friendship, false love, and false battle; but fiercest
      ever about the marriage bed and the betrayal of its vow. A thousand years
      from this night some wronged mother of hers, sitting beside some sleeping
      father of hers in their forest-beleaguered castle&mdash;the moonlight
      streaming in upon him through the javelined casement and putting before
      her the manly beauty of him&mdash;the blond hair matted thick on his
      forehead as his helmet had left it, his mouth reddening in his slumber
      under its curling gold&mdash;some mother of hers whom he had carried off
      from other men by might of his sword, thus sitting beside him and knowing
      him to be colder to her now than the moon&rsquo;s dead rays, might have watched
      those rays as they travelled away from his figure and put a gleam on his
      sword hanging near: a thousand years ago: some mother of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is when the best fails our human nature that the worst volunteers so
      often to take its place. The best and the worst&mdash;these are the sole
      alternatives which many a soul seems to be capable of making: hence life&rsquo;s
      spectacle of swift overthrow, of amazing collapse, ever present about us.
      Only the heroic among both men and women, losing the best as their first
      choice, fight their way through defeat to the standard of the second best
      and fight on there. And whatever one may think of the legend otherwise,
      abundant experience justifies the story that it was the Archangel who fell
      to the pit. The low never fall far: how can they? They already dwell on
      the bottom of things, and many a time they are to be seen there with
      vanity that they should inhabit such a privileged highland.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first of these hours which stretched for her into the tragic
      duration of a lifetime, it was a successive falling from a height of moral
      splendor; her nature went down through swift stages to the lowest she
      harbored either in the long channel of inheritance or as the stirred
      sediment of her own imperfections. And as is unfortunately true, this
      descent into moral darkness possessed the grateful illusion that it was an
      ascent into new light. All evil prompting became good suggestion; every
      injustice made its claim to be justification. She enjoyed the elation of
      feeling that she was dragging herself out of life&rsquo;s quicksands upward to
      some rock, where there might be loneliness for her, but where there would
      be cleanness. The love which consumed her for him raged in her as hatred;
      and hatred is born into perfect mastery of its weapons. However young, it
      needs not to wait for training in order to know how to destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He presented himself to her as a character at last revealed in its
      faithlessness and low carnal propensities. What rankled most poignantly in
      this spectacle of his final self-exposure was the fact that the cloven
      hoof should have been found on noble mountain tops&mdash;that he should
      have attempted to better his disguise by dwelling near regions of
      sublimity. Of all hypocrisy the kind most detestable to her was that which
      dares live within spiritual fortresses; and now his whole story of the
      Christmas Tree, the solemn marshalling of words about the growth of the
      world&rsquo;s spirit&mdash;about the sacrifice of the lower in ourselves to the
      higher&mdash;this cant now became to her the invocation and homage of the
      practised impostor: he had indeed carried the Christmas Tree on his
      shoulder into the manger. Not the Manger of Immortal Purity for mankind
      but the manger of his own bestiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus scorn and satire became her speech; she soared above him with
      spurning; a frenzy of poisoned joy racked her that at the moment when he
      had let her know that he wanted to be free&mdash;at that moment she might
      tell him he had won his freedom at the cheap price of his unworthiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus as she descended, she enjoyed the triumph of rising; so the devil
      in us never lacks argument that he is the celestial guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, hatred never dwells solitary; it readily finds boon companions.
      And at one period of the night she began to look back upon her experience
      with a curious sense of prior familiarity&mdash;to see it as a story
      already known to her at second hand. She viewed it as the first stage of
      one of those tragedies that later find their way into the care of family
      physicians, into the briefs of lawyers, into the confidence of clergymen,
      into the papers and divorce courts, and that receive their final flaying
      or canonization on the stage and in novels of the time. Sitting at a
      distance, she had within recent years studied in a kind of altruistic
      absorption how the nation&rsquo;s press, the nation&rsquo;s science of medicine, the
      nation&rsquo;s science of law, the nation&rsquo;s practice of religion, and the
      nation&rsquo;s imaginative literature were all at work with the same national
      omen&mdash;the decay of the American family and the downfall of the home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this new pestilence raging in other regions of the country had
      incredibly reached her, she thought, on the sheltered lowlands where the
      older traditions of American home life still lay like foundation rock. The
      corruption of it had attacked him; the ruin of it awaited her; and thus
      to-night she took her place among those women whom the world first hears
      of as in hospitals and sanitariums and places of refuge and in their
      graves&mdash;and more sadly elsewhere; whose misfortunes interested the
      press and whose types attracted the novelists.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They swarmed about her; one by one she recognized them: the woman who
      unable to bear up under her tragedy soon sinks into eternity&mdash;or
      walks into it; the woman who disappears from the scene and somewhere under
      another name or with another lot lives on&mdash;devoting herself to memory
      or to forgetfulness; the woman who stays on in the house, giving to the
      world no sign for the sake of everything else that still remains to her
      but living apart&mdash;on the other side of the locked door; the woman who
      stays on without locking the door, half-hating, half-loving&mdash;the
      accepted and rejected compromise; the woman who welcomes the end of the
      love-drama as the beginning of peace and the cessation of annoyances; the
      woman who begins to act her tragedy to servants and children and
      acquaintances&mdash;reaping sympathy for herself and sowing ruin and
      torture&mdash;for him; the woman who drops the care of house, ends his
      comforts, thus forcing the sharp reminder of her value as at least an
      investment toward his general well-being; the woman who endeavors to
      rekindle dying coals by fanning them with fresh fascinations; the woman
      who plays upon jealousy and touches the male instinct to keep one&rsquo;s own
      though little prized lest another acquire it and prize it more; the woman
      who sets a watch to discover the other woman: they swarmed about her, she
      identified each.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she dismissed them. They brought her no aid; she shrank from their
      companionship; a strange dread moved her lest <i>they</i> should discover
      <i>her</i>. One only she detached from the throng and for a while withdrew
      with her into a kind of dual solitude: the woman who when so rejected
      turns to another man&mdash;the man who is waiting somewhere near.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man <i>she</i> turned to, who for years had hovered near, was the
      country doctor, her husband&rsquo;s tried and closest friend, whose children
      were asleep upstairs with her children. During all these years <i>her</i>
      secret had been&mdash;the doctor. When she had come as a bride into that
      neighborhood, he, her husband&rsquo;s senior by several years, was already well
      established in his practice. He had attended her at the birth of her first
      child; never afterwards. As time passed, she had discovered that he loved
      her; she could never have him again. This had dealt his professional
      reputation a wound, but he understood, and he welcomed the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a night, lying awake near her window, through which noises from the
      turnpike plainly reached her, all earthly happiness asleep alongside her,
      she could hear the doctor&rsquo;s buggy passing on its way to some patient, or
      on its return from the town where he had patients also. Many a time she
      had heard it stop at the front gate: the road of his life there turned in
      to her. There were nights of pitch darkness and beating rain; and
      sometimes on these she had to know that he was out there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long she sat in the shadow of her room, looking towards the bed where her
      husband slept, but sending the dallying vision toward the doctor. He would
      be at the Christmas party; she would be dancing with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clouds and darkness descended upon the plain of life and enveloped it. She
      groped her way, torn and wounded, downward along the old lost human paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The endless night scarcely moved on.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wearied out, she was exhausted. There is anger of such intensity
      that it scorches and shrivels away the very temptations that are its fuel;
      nothing can long survive the blast of that white flame, and being unfed,
      it dies out. Moreover, it is the destiny of a portion of mankind that they
      are enjoined by their very nobility from winning low battles; these always
      go against them: the only victories for them are won when they are leading
      the higher forces of human nature in life&rsquo;s upward conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was weary, she was exhausted; there was in her for a while neither
      moral light nor moral darkness. Her consciousness lay like a boundless
      plain on which nothing is visible. She had passed into a great calm; and
      slowly there was borne across her spirit a clearness that is like the
      radiance of the storm-winged sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now in this calm, in this clearness, two small white figures appeared&mdash;her
      children. Hitherto the energies of her mind had grappled with the problem
      of her future; now memories began&mdash;memories that decide more perhaps
      than anything else for us. And memories began with her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arose without making any noise, took her candle, and screening it with
      the palm of her hand, started upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two ways by either of which she could go; a narrow rear
      stairway leading from the parlor straight to their bedrooms, and the broad
      stairway in the front hall. From the old maternal night-habit she started
      to take the shorter way but thought of the parlor and drew back. This room
      had become too truly the Judgment Seat of the Years. She shrank from it as
      one who has been arraigned may shrink from a tribunal where sentence has
      been pronounced which changes the rest of life. Its flowers, its fruits,
      its toys, its ribbons, but deepened the derision and the bitterness. And
      the evergreen there in the middle of the room&mdash;it became to her as
      that tree of the knowledge of good and evil which at Creation&rsquo;s morning
      had driven Woman from Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She chose the other way and started toward the main hall of the house, but
      paused in the doorway and looked back at the bed; what if he should awake
      in the dark, alone, with no knowledge of where she was? Would he call out
      to her&mdash;with what voice? Would he come to seek her&mdash;with what
      emotions? (The tide of memories was setting in now&mdash;the drift back to
      the old mooring.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Hunt for her! How those words fell like iron strokes on the ear of
      remembrance. They registered the beginning of the whole trouble. Up to the
      last two years his first act upon reaching home had been to seek her. It
      had even been her playfulness at times to slip from room to room for the
      delight of proving how persistently he would prolong his search. But one
      day some two years before this, when she had entered his study about the
      usual hour of his return, bringing flowers for his writing desk, she saw
      him sitting there, hat on, driving gloves on, making some notes. The sight
      had struck the flowers from her hands; she swiftly gathered them up, and
      going to her room, shut herself in; she knew it was the beginning of the
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shadow which lurks in every bridal lamp had become the Spectre of the
      bedchamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they met later that day, he was not even aware of what he had done or
      failed to do, the change in him was so natural to himself. Everything else
      had followed: the old look dying out of the eyes; the old touch abandoning
      the hands; less time for her in the house, more for work; constraint
      beginning between them, the awkwardness of reserve; she seeing Nature&rsquo;s
      movement yet refusing to believe it; then at last resolving to know to the
      uttermost and choosing her bridal night as the hour of the ordeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he awoke, would he come to seek her&mdash;with what feelings?
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on upstairs, holding the candle to one side with her right hand
      and supporting herself by the banisters with her left. There was a turn in
      the stairway at the second floor, and here the candle rays fell on the
      face of the tall clock in the hallway. She sat down on a step, putting the
      candle beside her; and there she remained, her elbows on her knees, her
      face resting on her palms; and into the abyss of the night dropped the
      tranquil strokes. More memories!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was by nature not only alive to all life but alive to surrounding
      lifeless things. Much alone in the house, she had sent her happiness
      overflowing its dumb environs&mdash;humanizing these&mdash;drawing them
      toward her by a gracious responsive symbolism&mdash;extending speech over
      realms which nature has not yet awakened to it or which she may have
      struck into speechlessness long æons past.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had symbolized the clock; it was the wooden God of Hours; she had
      often feigned that it might be propitiated; and opening the door of it she
      would pin inside the walls little clusters of blossoms as votive
      offerings: if it would only move faster and bring him home! The usual hour
      of his return from college was three in the afternoon. She had symbolized
      that hour; one stroke for him, one for her, one for the children&mdash;the
      three in one&mdash;the trinity of the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat there on the step with the candle burning beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck three! The sound went through the house: down to him, up
      to the children, into her. It was like a cry of a night watch: all is
      well!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first sound that had reached her from any source during this
      agony, and now it did not come from humanity, but from outside humanity;
      from Time itself which brings us together and holds us together as long as
      possible and then separates us and goes on its way&mdash;indifferent
      whether we are together or apart; Time which welds the sands into the rock
      and then wears the rock away to its separate sands and sends the level
      tide softly over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once for him, once for her, once for the children! She took up the candle
      and went upstairs to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while she stood beside the bed in one room where the two little
      girls were asleep clasping each other, cheek against cheek; and in another
      room at the bedside of the two little boys, their backs turned on one
      another and each with a hand doubled into a promising fist outside the
      cover. In a few years how differently the four would be divided and
      paired; each boy a young husband, each girl a young wife; and out of the
      lives of the two of them who were hers she would then drop into some
      second place. If to-night she were realizing what befalls a wife when she
      becomes the Incident to her husband, she would then realize what befalls a
      woman when the mother becomes the Incident to her children: Woman, twice
      the Incident in Nature&rsquo;s impartial economy! Her son would playfully
      confide it to his bride that she must bear with his mother&rsquo;s whims and
      ways. Her daughter would caution her husband that he must overlook
      peculiarities and weaknesses. The very study of perfection which she
      herself had kindled and fanned in them as the illumination of their lives
      they would now turn upon her as a searchlight of her failings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He downstairs would never do that! She could not conceive of his
      discussing her with any human being. Even though he should some day desert
      her, he would never discuss her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had lived so secure in the sense of him thus standing with her against
      the world, that it was the sheer withdrawal of his strength from her
      to-night that had dealt her the cruelest blow. But now she began to ask
      herself whether his protection <i>had</i> failed her. Could he have
      recognized the situation without rendering it worse? Had he put his arms
      around her, might she not have&mdash;struck at him? Had he laid a
      finger-weight of sympathy on her, would it not have left a scar for life?
      Any words of his, would they not have rung in her ears unceasingly? To
      pass it over was as though it had never been&mdash;was not <i>that</i> his
      protection?
    </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly felt a desire to go down into the parlor. She kissed her
      child in each room and she returned and kissed the doctor&rsquo;s children&mdash;with
      memory of their mother; and then she descended by the rear stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      She set her candle on the table, where earlier in the night she had placed
      the lamp&mdash;near the manuscript&mdash;and she sat down and looked at
      that remorsefully: she had ignored it when he placed it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made her the gift of his work&mdash;dedicated to her the triumphs
      of his toil. It was his deep cry to her to share with him his widening
      career and enter with him into the world&rsquo;s service. She crossed her hands
      over it awhile, and then she left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The low-burnt candle did not penetrate far into the darkness of the
      immense parlor. There was an easy chair near her piano and her music.
      After playing when alone, she would often sit there and listen to the
      echoes of those influences that come into the soul from music only,&mdash;the
      rhythmic hauntings of some heaven of diviner beauty. She sat there now
      quite in darkness and closed her eyes; and upon her ear began faintly to
      beat the sad sublime tones of his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of her delights in growing things on the farm had been to watch the
      youth of the hemp&mdash;a field of it, tall and wandlike and tufted. If
      the north wind blew upon it, the myriad stalks as by a common impulse
      swayed southward; if a zephyr from the south crossed it, all heads were
      instantly bowed before the north. West wind sent it east and east wind
      sent it west.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, it had seemed to her, is that ever living world which we sometimes
      call the field of human life in its perpetual summer. It is run through by
      many different laws; governed by many distinct forces, each of which
      strives to control it wholly&mdash;but never does. Selfishness blows on it
      like a parching sirocco, and all things seem to bow to the might of
      selfishness. Generosity moves across the expanse, and all things are seen
      responsive to what is generous. Place yourself where life is lowest and
      everything like an avalanche is rushing to the bottom. Place yourself
      where character is highest, and lo! the whole world is but one struggle
      upward to what is high. You see what you care to see, and find what you
      wish to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his story of the Forest and the Heart he had wanted to trace but one
      law, and he had traced it; he had drawn all things together and bent them
      before its majesty: the ancient law of Sacrifice. Of old the high
      sacrificed to the low; afterwards the low to the high: once the sacrifice
      of others; now the sacrifice of ourselves; but always in ourselves of the
      lower to the higher in order that, dying, we may live.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this law he had made his story a story of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The star on the Tree bore it back to Chaldæa; the candle bore it to
      ancient Persia; the cross bore it to the Nile and Isis and Osiris; the
      dove bore it to Syria; the bell bore it to Confucius; the drum bore it to
      Buddha; the drinking horn to Greece; the tinsel to Romulus and Rome; the
      doll to Abraham and Isaac; the masks to Gaul; the mistletoe to Britain,&mdash;and
      all brought it to Christ,&mdash;Christ the latest world-ideal of sacrifice
      that is self-sacrifice and of the giving of all for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story was for herself, he had said, and for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Himself! Here at last all her pain and wandering of this night ended: at
      the bottom of her wound where rankled <i>his problem</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this problem she had most shrunk and into this she now entered: She
      sacrificed herself in him! She laid upon herself his temptation and his
      struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking her candle, she passed back into her bedroom and screened it where
      she had screened it before; then went into his bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her wedding ring on again with blanched lips. She went to his
      bedside, and drawing to the pillow the chair on which his clothes were
      piled, sat down and laid her face over on it; and there in that shrine of
      feeling where speech is formed, but whence it never issues, she made her
      last communion with him:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;You, to whom I gave my youth and all that youth could mean to me;
      whose children I have borne and nurtured at my breast&mdash;all of whose
      eyes I have seen open and the eyes of some of whom I have closed; husband
      of my girlhood, loved as no woman ever loved the man who took her home;
      strength and laughter of his house; helper of what is best in me; my
      defender against things in myself that I cannot govern; pathfinder of my
      future; rock of the ebbing years! Though my hair turn white as driven snow
      and flesh wither to the bone, I shall never cease to be the flame that you
      yourself have kindled. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But never again to you! Let the stillness of nature fall where there must
      be stillness! Peace come with its peace! And the room which heard our
      whisperings of the night, let it be the Room of the Silences&mdash;the
      Long Silences! Adieu, cross of living fire that I have so clung to!&mdash;Adieu!&mdash;Adieu!&mdash;Adieu!&mdash;Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remained as motionless as though she had fallen asleep or would not
      lift her head until there had ebbed out of her life upon his pillow the
      last drop of things that must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      She there&mdash;her whitening head buried on his pillow: it was Life&rsquo;s
      Calvary of the Snows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dawn found her sitting in the darkest corner of the room, and there it
      brightened about her desolately. The moment drew near when she must awaken
      him; the ordeal of their meeting must be over before the children rushed
      downstairs or the servants knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had plaited her hair in two heavy braids, and down each braid the gray
      told its story through the black. And she had brushed it frankly away from
      brow and temples so that the contour of her head&mdash;one of nature&rsquo;s
      noblest&mdash;was seen in its simplicity. It is thus that the women of her
      land sometimes prepare themselves at the ceremony of their baptism into a
      new life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had put on a plain night-dress, and her face and shoulders rising out
      of this had the austerity of marble&mdash;exempt not from ruin, but exempt
      from lesser mutation. She looked down at her wrists once and made a little
      instinctive movement with her fingers as if to hide them under the
      sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she approached the bed. As she did so, she turned back midway and
      quickly stretched her arms toward the wall as though to flee to it. Then
      she drew nearer, a new pitiful fear of him in her eyes&mdash;the look of
      the rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she stood an instant and then she reclined on the edge of the bed,
      resting on one elbow and looking down at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For years her first words to him on this day had been the world&rsquo;s best
      greeting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Merry Christmas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried to summon the words to her lips and have them ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the pressure of her body on the bed he opened his eyes and instantly
      looked to see what the whole truth was: how she had come out of it all,
      what their life was to be henceforth, what their future would be worth.
      But at the sight of her so changed&mdash;something so gone out of her
      forever&mdash;with a quick cry he reached his arms for her. She struggled
      to get away from him; but he, winding his arms shelteringly about the
      youth-shorn head, drew her face close down against his face. She caught at
      one of the braids of her hair and threw it across her eyes, and then
      silent convulsive sobs rent and tore her, tore her. The torrent of her
      tears raining down into his tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears not for Life&rsquo;s faults but for Life when there are no faults. They
      locked in each other&rsquo;s arms&mdash;trying to save each other on Nature&rsquo;s
      vast lonely, tossing, uncaring sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rush of children&rsquo;s feet was heard in the hall and there was smothered
      laughter at the door and the soft turning of the knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Christmas Morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun rose golden and gathering up its gold threw it forward over the
      gladness of the Shield. The farmhouse&mdash;such as the poet had sung of
      when he could not help singing of American home life&mdash;looked out from
      under its winter roof with the cheeriness of a human traveller who laughs
      at the snow on his hat and shoulders. Smoke poured out of its chimneys,
      bespeaking brisk fires for festive purposes. The oak tree beside it stood
      quieted of its moaning and tossing. Soon after sunrise a soul of passion
      on scarlet wings, rising out of the snow-bowed shrubbery, flew up to a
      topmost twig of the oak; and sitting there with its breast to the gorgeous
      sun scanned for a little while that landscape of ice. It was beyond its
      intelligence to understand how nature could create it for Summer and then
      take Summer away. Its wisdom could only have ended in wonderment that a
      sun so true could shine on a world so false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frolicking servants fell to work, sweeping porches and shovelling paths.
      After breakfast a heavy-set, middle-aged man, his face red with fireside
      warmth and laughter, without hat or gloves or overcoat, rushed out of the
      front door pursued by a little soldier sternly booted and capped and
      gloved; and the two snowballed each other, going at it furiously. Watching
      them through a window a little girl, dancing a dreamy measure of her own,
      ever turned inward and beckoned to some one to come and look&mdash;beckoned
      in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day the little boy beat the drum of Confucius; all day the little girl
      played with the doll&mdash;hugged to her breast the symbol of ancient
      sacrifice, the emblem of the world&rsquo;s new mercy. Along the turnpike
      sleigh-bells were borne hither and thither by rushing horses; and the
      shouts of young men on fire to their marrow went echoing across the
      shining valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas Day! Christmas Day! Christmas Day!
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing about the house stood in tragic aloofness from its surroundings;
      just outside the bedroom window grew a cedar, low, thick, covered with
      snow except where a bough had been broken off for decorating the house;
      here owing to the steepness the snow slid off. The spot looked like a
      wound in the side of the Divine purity, and across this open wound the
      tree had hung its rosary-beads never to be told by Sorrow&rsquo;s fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunset golden and gathering up its last gold threw it backward across
      the sadness of the Shield. One by one the stars came back to their
      faithful places above the silence and the whiteness. A swinging lamp was
      lighted on the front porch and its rays fell on little round mats of snow
      stamped off by entering boot heels. On each gatepost a low Christmas star
      was set to guide and welcome good neighbors; and between those beacons
      soon they came hurrying, fathers and mothers and children assembling for
      the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late into the night the party lasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The logs blazed in deep fireplaces and their Forest Memories went to
      ashes. Bodily comfort there was and good-will and good wishes and the
      robust sensible making the best of what is best on the surface of our
      life. And hale eating and drinking as old England itself once ate and
      drank at Yuletide. And fast music and dancing that ever wanted to go
      faster than the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief feature of the revelry was the distribution of gifts on the
      Christmas Tree&mdash;the handing over to this person and to that person of
      those unread lessons of the ages&mdash;little mummied packages of the lord
      of time. One thing no one noted. Fresh candles had replaced those burnt
      out on the Tree the night before: all the candles were white now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revellers! Revellers! A crowded canvas! A brilliantly painted scene!
      Controlling everything, controlling herself, the lady of the house:
      hunting out her guests with some grace that befitted each; laughing and
      talking with the doctor; secretly giving most attention to the doctor&rsquo;s
      wife&mdash;faded little sufferer; with strength in her to be the American
      wife and mother in the home of the poet&rsquo;s dream: the spiritual majesty of
      her bridal veil still about her amid life&rsquo;s snow as it never lifts itself
      from the face of the <i>Jungfrau</i> amid the sad most lovely mountains:
      the American wife and mother!&mdash;herself the <i>Jungfrau</i> among the
      world&rsquo;s women!
    </p>
    <p>
      The last thing before the company broke up took place what often takes
      place there in happy gatherings: the singing of the song of the State
      which is also a song of the Nation&mdash;its melody of the unfallen home:
      with sadness enough in it, God knows, but with sanctity: she seated at the
      piano&mdash;the others upholding her like a living bulwark.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another company thronging the rooms that no one wot of: those
      Bodiless Ones that often are much more real than the embodied&mdash;the
      Guests of the Imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Memories were there, strolling back and forth through the chambers arm
      and arm with the Years: bestowing no cognizance upon that present scene
      nor aware that they were not alone. About the Christmas Tree the Wraiths
      of earlier children returned to gambol; and these knew naught of those
      later ones who had strangely come out of the unknown to fill their places.
      Around the walls stood other majestical Veiled Shapes that bent undivided
      attention upon the actual pageant: these were Life&rsquo;s Pities. Ever and anon
      they would lift their noble veils and look out upon that brief flicker of
      our mortal joy, and drop them and relapse into their compassionate vigil.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of the Bodiless Ones there gathered a solitary young Shape filled the
      entire house with her presence. As the Memories walked through the rooms
      with the Years, they paused ever before her and mutely beckoned her to a
      place in their Sisterhood. The children who had wandered back peeped shyly
      at her but then with some sure instinct of recognition ran to her and
      threw down their gifts, to put their arms around her. And the Pities
      before they left the house that night walked past her one by one and each
      lifted its veil and dropped it more softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the Shape:
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great bedroom on a spot of the carpet under the chandelier&mdash;which
      had no decoration whatsoever&mdash;stood an exquisite Spirit of Youth,
      more insubstantial than Spring morning mist, yet most alive; her lips
      scarce parted&mdash;her skin like white hawthorn shadowed by pink&mdash;in
      her eyes the modesty of withdrawal from Love&mdash;in her heart the
      surrender to it. During those distracting hours never did she move nor did
      her look once change: she waiting there&mdash;waiting for some one to come&mdash;waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waiting.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
