description: After an initial burst of literary popularity, Kentucky-born author James
  Lane Allen took an extended break from publishing. After the span of several years,
  he returned with the short novel Bride of the Mistletoe, which both reflected and
  diverged from his earlier work. Though also a romance of sorts, the tale is shot
  through with myth and steeped in symbolism, adding weight and gravity to what otherwise
  might be a light diversion.
